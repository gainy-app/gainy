However, such<strong> </strong>poor planning<strong> </strong>would be relevant in the beginning of the 20th century. Because those born in 1910 the expectancy was to live to 49 years of age. Most of the people at that time didn’t even think of any pension or retirement. They simply didn’t live that long.&nbsp;<br></p><p>According to statistics, over the past 160 years, life expectancy (from birth) in the United States has risen from 39.4 years in 1860, to 78.9 years in 2020. <br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:1000px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6164d226b2dbc9e55acb68a4_04%20Img%20-%203.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="average life expectancy photo"></div></figure><p>Life expectancy is increasing, biotechnologies prolong lives, but can you always work as effectively as now? <strong>Or do you even WANT to work later in life?</strong></p><p>‍</p><h3>🌚 Why care? The government offers retirement plans. </h3><p>It will hardly cover your usual expenditures. There is also no guarantee that your pension fund won’t go bankrupt. Have a look at these two pieces of news<a href="https://www.notion.so/a96c54a14a7b4e058257f985cb2861f3">‍</a></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.notion.so/a96c54a14a7b4e058257f985cb2861f3">“the weak financial condition of seven <strong>US</strong> public <strong>pension</strong> plans threatens to deplete their assets by 2028”</a> </li><li>and most recent “A Michigan-based pension fund is suing Credit Suisse over failures related to the recent collapses of supply chain funds Greensill and family office Archegos”.</li></ul><p>The official system is just too fragile and inefficient. Therefore, the situation calls to take responsibility for your own money and start managing it without intermediaries.</p><p>‍</p><h3>🌚 It’s difficult, I don''t have any special education.<br></h3><p>Investing has become easier and accessible so that more than a half of Americans (55% to be precise) own stocks. </p><p>And the number of retail investors is growing each year worldwide, over 10 million new brokerage accounts were opened in 2020<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-army-of-individual-investors-flexes-its-muscle-11609329600" target="_blank">*</a>. Because more people are taking action to make their future safer. It’s like with a phone. Once you relied on an intermediary like telephone booth or agent to call, now you can use our own smartphones.</p><p>‍</p><h3>🌚 Retirement is too far and maybe the least concerning matter for me.</h3><p>That’s right, there are more acute challenges, such as replacement of our jobs with robots or algorithms or that pollution forces us to move to cleaner places, or sudden outbursts of virus makes us stay isolated, you name it.</p><p>With the world changing at such a high pace, all we need to prepare for is uncertainty. Nassim Taleb is one the most renowned writers (and former stock trader) who brings in these matters. In his book “Antifragile” he talks about surviving in such turbulent conditions. The best quality a person can have now is antifragility.</p><p>‍<strong>Antifragility means that something does not merely withstand a shock but actually improves because of it.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>You can be very skillful and adaptive and thrive in times of crises but... it still takes time to find a job, move to a new place, learn a new skill. Transition periods require money to get through. Hence, saving appears not just a good habit to have, but a vital thing to do for your antifragility. Those who have savings feel more confident, can be more adaptive to uncertainty and thus, are happier.</p><p>‍</p><h3>🌚 I have a savings account in a bank. Does it count?</h3><p>‍It counts if you are satisfied with your yield. Because there is one thing we tend to forget—inflation. When you start saving, your money loses value over a period of time because everything rises in prices—that’s inflation. One of the ways to understand inflation is with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). CPI is a measure that examines the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/weightedaverage.asp">weighted average</a> of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. The historical data for CPI is shown on the chart below.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:1000px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6164d239ac33d77c1561e593_04%20Img%20-%204.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Consumer price index inflation photo"></div></figure><p>It means that with $1000 now you can buy ~1,7 times less than in 1996.<br>Bank deposits offer near-zero rates which don’t help save your money.</p><p>‍</p><h3>🌚 Alright, what other options do I have?</h3><p>You need something that would beat the inflation and set the stream of passive income.

But for an easy start and faster capital gains the stock market is the way to go. Although investing in the stock market has this vibe of complexity or eliteness, in essence it’s just buying shares of companies. You can cash it out any moment by selling them.</p><p>‍</p><h3>🌚 What’s the strategy with stocks?</h3><p>A simple and conservative way is to invest in the whole market through the S&amp;P 500 index. The more difficult and rewarding way is to pick individual companies. For example, Apple has risen 100% in the last year, and 4.7 times in 5 years.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6164d6b5c6c2a2ae8c6413d0_04%20Img%20-%208.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="apple stock growth photo"></div><figcaption>$1000 in Apple Stocks</figcaption></figure><p><br></p><p>So if you had invested $5,000 last year, you would have had $10,000 now.

What is the probability of Apple going bankrupt? Or General Motors? Or Bank of America?

Some are up as early as 4 a.m. to start trading stocks. Yet, surprisingly, the financial markets do sleep. But some traders do trade directly while the stock exchange is closed.</p><p>This article will tell you the basics of trading hours for the major stock exchanges in the US. Read on to find out everything you need to know.<br>‍</p><h2>Stock Market Trading Hours</h2><h3>NYSE and Nasdaq</h3><h4>The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) </h4><p>is the largest stock exchange in the world and the oldest existing exchange in the US. It was officially established in 1817 as the New York Stock and Exchange Board, although it dates back to 1792 when 24 stockbrokers met under the buttonwood tree on what came to be known as Wall Street in Manhattan, New York. Its main trading floor is on Wall St, but the majority of trades go through its primary datacenter in Mahwah, New Jersey.</p><h4>Nasdaq Stock Market </h4><p><strong>‍</strong>is the other major US stock exchange that began operating in 1971 as the world’s first electronic stock market. Many tech giants, such as Facebook, Apple and Amazon are listed here. It also became the first US stock market to start trading online in 1998. That’s why the Nasdaq index famously peaked during the dot-com bubble, only to fall back to around the same level after the bubble burst.</p><p>Nasdaq also has offices in Manhattan, a few miles away from Wall Street, but there’s no trading floor as it’s fully electronic.</p><p>When people say the stock market, they are usually referring to NYSE and Nasdaq. Their trading hours are the same as Nasdaq follows the NYSE schedule.</p><p><strong>Stock market times:</strong></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168b650782ab15bdeb83cdb_02%20Img%20-%201.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="table US stock exchanges opening hours - photo"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168b65b6d6a1ca5e7558ddb_02%20Img%20-%202.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="meme man waiting while the stock market is closed - photo"></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>The stock market is closed on some but not all federal holidays. On some of them it works as normal or closes early.</p><p><strong>Here is a list of holiday trading hours for 2021:</strong></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168b666493cf12055b0ae4e_02%20Img%20-%203.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="table with stock market working hours on holidays - photo"></div></figure><p>Other financial markets operate on a different schedule. For example, futures contracts begin trading at 6 p.m. on Sundays. This includes equity futures, oil, commodities and agricultural products.&nbsp;</p><p>The holiday schedule for bond markets is independent from the stock market—they open on some days when the stock markets are closed and close at 2 p.m. on some holidays when the stock markets are open.<br></p><h3>Pre-market and after hours trading</h3><p>Some trading happens outside of regular trading hours. Before the market opens at 9:30 a.m. traders can create buy and sell orders from 6:30 a.m., and sometimes as early as 4 a.m. This is known as pre-market trading.</p><p>After-hours sessions happen after stock market close time and usually run from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. Investors trade in the after-hours because they can benefit from the ‘unofficial’ prices while the market is asleep.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies tend to release key news in the after-hours, such as the departure of a key company member. This lets investors trade in anticipation of the ‘official’ price changes when the stock market reopens.</p><p>Trading outside of normal hours is done through Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs), such as Archipelago, Instinet, SelectNet and NYSE Arca. These systems pair up buyers and sellers directly.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168b6750e9f3ff6c8f41ae7_02%20Img%20-%204.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>After-hours trading has its limitations. There is less trading happening so prices can be more influenced by single sales and more volatile. It may be hard to match asking prices and bids, making some transactions difficult to complete.</p><p>As the official price is frozen in time until the markets reopen, the after-hours prices do not reflect the actual price upon reopening, and it’s possible that you won’t be able to get the best price in the after hours.<strong>‍</strong></p><h4><strong>The pros and cons of after market trading</strong>‍</h4><p>✅ Can be a good way to capitalize on important news released while the&nbsp; markets are closed</p><p>❌ Less trades happening—stocks are not as liquid</p><p>❌ May be hard to get a good price or complete a transaction<br></p><h2>Is the Stock Market Open on Weekends?&nbsp;</h2><p>If you’re just starting out, you already have enough things to do between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m on weekdays, right? So maybe you can trade on weekends instead?</p><p>Although the major stock exchanges are closed on Saturdays and Sundays, it’s still possible to trade. As with pre-market and after-hour trading, this is done through ECNs.<strong>‍</strong></p><blockquote>💡 Interesting fact: The New York Stock Exchange used to open for a short day&nbsp;of trading on Saturdays, but this was discontinued in 1952.</blockquote><p>If you look at the stock graphs, they look continuous but they don’t account for non-trading hours. The stock prices at 9:30 a.m. on Monday directly follow the price at 4 p.m. the previous Friday. There isn’t always a significant jump in price, but when there is, this is usually due to trades that happened while the markets were closed.</p><p>The pros and cons of trading on the weekend are the same as trading in the after-hours. Stocks are not as liquid (i.e. less trades happening), and the spread between the bid and ask prices can be wider.</p><h2>FAQ<br></h2>', 'When does the stock market open and close?

It can apply to anything from the banking system as a whole to individuals.</p><p>What does liquidity mean in stocks and what is stock market liquidity? We’ll answer these and other questions in this guide.</p><h2>What is Liquidity?</h2><p>Liquidity refers to how quickly and efficiently you can buy or sell an asset without affecting its price. The easier it is to buy and sell an asset, the more liquid it is.</p><p>The most liquid asset is cash. You don’t need to exchange it for anything to get value out of it—it’s already in the most liquid form. It can be exchanged for other assets quickly and easily.</p><p>An example of an illiquid asset would be a house, a car, works of art or antiques. No matter how valuable these are, you might have to wait to sell them at a good price. If you need to sell fast you’re very likely to have to sell at a considerably lower price.</p><h3>Market Liquidity</h3><p>In the context of a market as a whole, liquidity refers to how easily transactions can occur. If there are enough buyers and sellers, demand and supply are balanced. If there is not enough demand or not enough supply, this may result in lower liquidity.</p><p>A market with higher liquidity levels makes it easier for buyers and sellers to find other traders and make transactions at prices they prefer. A lower liquidity might make it hard to complete transactions, thus increasing the bid-ask spread.</p><p>This is especially important if a market is moving negatively and a trader wishes to exit a position. In a liquid market it’s still possible to sell an asset without making a loss. But if liquidity is low, traders might have to sell at a considerably lower price—a bit like with other illiquid assets we’ve mentioned before, such as a house or a car.&nbsp;</p><h4>🌊 &nbsp;Liquid market:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>many buyers and sellers</li><li>many trades happening</li><li>able to buy or sell at the preferred price</li><li>small bid-ask spread</li></ul><h4>🥶 &nbsp;Illiquid market:</h4><ul><li>low supply or demand</li><li>few trades happening</li><li>might be hard to sell or buy at the preferred price</li><li>large bid-ask spread</li></ul><p>The most liquid market in the world is forex. It’s full of participants, from large banks and corporations to professional traders and individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>The securities market is considered to be very liquid. Most securities, such as stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, bonds and commodities are liquid assets and can be sold almost immediately during normal trading hours. Conversely, trying to sell them outside of regular trading hours can make them illiquid because the majority of the market is not active at that time. </p><p>‍</p><h2>What is Liquidity in Stocks?</h2><p>Stock liquidity is determined by how accessible a stock is and how easily and efficiently it can be bought or sold without impacting its price. Liquid stocks will have enough demand and supply of shares, i.e. there are enough buyers and sellers in the market and transactions can happen smoothly.</p><p>Stocks of companies with the largest market capitalization are the most liquid. They are traded frequently on the stock market and it’s easy to buy or sell them quickly and at a desired price.</p><p>Investing in a stock with high liquidity is generally safer than those with low liquidity. Liquidity is a major factor traders use to assess an investment. Illiquid stocks are usually sold at a discount.</p><p>Stock liquidity definition: how easily and efficiently a stock can be bought or sold on the stock market without a major impact on its price.<br></p><p><br></p><h2>Types of Stock Liquidity</h2><h3>Liquid stocks</h3><p>Stocks listed on major exchanges (such as NYSE and Nasdaq) are usually very liquid, especially stocks with high market capitalization, such as Apple, Alphabet and Tesla. They can usually be sold for the market price even if the market is moving downwards.</p><p><strong>Large-cap stocks:</strong> $10 billion or more</p><p><strong>Mid-cap stocks:</strong> $2-10 billion</p><p><strong>Small-cap stocks:</strong> between $300 million and $2 billion</p><p>Large-cap and mid-cap stocks are generally very liquid. Small-cap stocks can be liquid too, but usually less liquid than those with higher capitalization.</p><h3>Illiquid stocks</h3><p>If a stock cannot be sold easily without a considerable loss, it is considered illiquid. Such stocks are more high-risk to investors as it might be harder to find a buyer unlike stocks that are traded frequently.</p><p>It’s part of a trader’s routine research for an investor to identify illiquid stocks and avoid them.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168b846be2413f4b6188da6_03%20Img%20-%201.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="tesla TSLA stock price graph - photo"></div><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Tesla shares: liquid asset</strong></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168b851460de6b253881919_03%20Img%20-%202.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="converse shoes ebay listing - photo"></div></figure><p><strong>Converse Dr. X Romanelli Popeye Beetle Bailey Wool Marine: illiquid asset</strong>‍<br></p><h2>Key Indicators of Stock Liquidity</h2><h3>Trading Volume</h3><p>One of the key characteristics of stock liquidity is its trading volume.&nbsp;</p><p>A stock is highly liquid if, on average:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>it trades at least 100 times every day&nbsp;</li><li>has a daily trading volume of at least $1 million<br></li></ul><blockquote><em>Buying or selling 10% of the overall trading volume can have a negative effect on liquidity of an asset.</em></blockquote><h3>Spread</h3><p>Another measure of stock liquidity is the difference between bid and ask prices or the bid-ask spread. Transactions can only occur when the highest price a buyer is prepared to pay matches the lowest price a seller will accept. If the bid-ask spread is high this is a sign that an asset is illiquid.</p><h3>Share turnover</h3><p>Another key measure of liquidity is the comparison of the trading volume of shares to the number of shares outstanding. This is known as share turnover. If this level is high, traders can buy and sell shares more easily.</p><p>To work out share turnover, you need to divide the total number of shares traded by the average number of available shares.</p><p>If 1 million shares were sold in the last 12 months and the number of available shares was 100 thousand, the share turnover is 10x.<br></p><blockquote>Measuring share turnover<br>number of shares / average number of shares available = share turnover</blockquote><p><br></p><h2>The Importance of Stock Liquidity for Investors and Traders</h2><h3>Why is liquidity in stocks important?</h3><p>Liquidity in stocks is important because it determines how quickly and efficiently you can buy or sell shares.</p><p>High liquidity is associated with lower risk. A liquid stock is more likely to keep its value when being traded. The market is busy and it’s easy to find a buyer or seller on the other side. This means it’s less likely a trader would have to buy it for more or sell for less than the market price.</p><blockquote>Invest in stocks with high liquidity</blockquote><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Liquidity is a very overall characteristic that can apply to individual assets, markets and the banking system as a whole. This concept is almost as fundamental as price.</p><p>It is generally safer to trade stocks and other assets with high liquidity. When trading illiquid stocks, investors have to be aware of the risks involved. It has to be said that the rewards may be high as well but the risks are likely to outweigh them. If your investment portfolio is heavily diversified, it’s good practice to do portfolio health checks to see if it’s possible to increase liquidity by selling off illiquid assets.</p><p>Likewise, when entering a new market, it’s important to quickly analyze that market’s liquidity.&nbsp; A liquid market makes it easier for traders to find other buyers and sellers and everyone can trade at prices they’re happy with.</p><h2>FAQ<br></h2>', 'Liquidity is one of the most fundamental concepts in finance and business in general.

You will gain more if you hold it for several years.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s why I’ve already mentioned before that it’s important to set a price goal or time period for the company and not to sell despite dips.<br></p><p>Fortunately, Gainy recommends companies taking into account your time period and yield preferences.

Do you have balance in positions?&nbsp;</h3><p>The perfect scenario is if you have stocks with the same total values. Otherwise, there is a risk that your one expensive $3,500 stock in Amazon could pull down an entire portfolio of $100 in 10 other assets.<br></p><p>Imagine you have one Google share which costs $2,800, one Microsoft share at $179 and one Intel share at $52.&nbsp;</p><p>The Google stock drops 2%, the other two grow 10%.

Do you have free cash so you’re able to buy on drawdowns and to average positions?</h3><p>\tIt’s considered good practice to keep 10-15% of funds in cash, but if you sense the RISK ON situation on the market (like now) you can increase the share of free cash up to 50%.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>6. Do you have price targets for each stock? How much growth do you want to achieve as a result?</h3><p>\tTo avoid emotional swings, set targets for each stock. So that you don’t get nervous when you see +13% on some stock because you know that you expect +15%. Execute these targets and don’t regret that you sold them too early. <em>It’s better to underearn than to lose.&nbsp;</em><br></p><h3>7. What loss are you willing to suffer on an asset before you sell?</h3><p>\tThe same principle as in the previous point. Set limits to your losses. Because if the stock is falling, then it’s worth selling now and maybe buying it cheaper. Books say to put stop-loss at -2%, but some stocks can be so volatile that they swing +/- 2% a day. So build the individual stop-loss on each stock.<br></p><h2>WHERE TO FIND SO MANY STOCKS TO DIVERSIFY YOUR PORTFOLIO CORRECTLY?<br></h2><p>1.

Gainy — a stock picking and portfolio analyzing app made by professional traders', 'How To Increase Your Returns', '<h3>🌚 How to earn money fast?<br>1. Trading. </h3><p><strong>‍</strong>On the Internet you see a lot of ads of successful traders with stock recommendations, trading strategies, and online courses. Trading strategies are based on buying stocks at the right moment and selling them later after some time. Usually, periods are very short: from hours to several days. Not all of them are effective, but the simplest and fundamental ones were described in one of the previous letters devoted to technical analysis. </p><p>You buy stocks when you see big dips and expect them to jump high back. This strategy works and you can find such stocks in our section <strong>“</strong>Momentum Stocks<strong>”</strong> but you should always measure the risk you’re taking.<br></p><p>For example, a stock costs $93 at the moment. Based on the chart the local minimum is at $90, we suppose that price might fall until 90 and have support there. Thus, the potential risk is $3. But it’s also possible that it doesn''t fall and start growing. The local maximum is $100, so the potential upside is $7 ($100-$93).</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168dd894e2c4ab3651013dd_11%20Img%20-%201.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="risk and profit ratio photo"></div></figure><p>The risk/profit ratio is 3/7. It means that for each dollar you risk, you can earn 2.3 dollars of reward.&nbsp;Usually, the more risk you’re taking, the more profit you can make. The optimal rate is ⅓.</p><p>It is most important for speculative trades. So that next time if you see a falling stock and you consider buying it, measure the risk/profit ratio.&nbsp;<br>For example, this case is not the best to invest in at the moment. Because you can earn as much money as you lose.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168dd93c794c404d5653ed4_11%20Img%20-%202.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="investment strategy risk profit equal photo"></div></figure><p>This one is the best because you are already at the lowest point.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168dd9d61f7eb42f0e096f3_11%20Img%20-%203.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="investment strategy low risk photo"></div></figure><h3><strong>2. </strong>Also, you can buy<strong> IPOs</strong> (Initial Public Offering)</h3><p>It’s when a company goes public and starts selling its stocks. Most times, companies are cheaper in the beginning and become more expensive as time goes by. At the IPO Amazon’s shares cost $18 in 1997, now their price is over $3000.&nbsp;</p><p>But if we talk about short-term gains, there is a pattern we see at IPOs. Stock prices jump the first day, then fall a bit and around 2-3 weeks start growing again.&nbsp;</p><p>See the 4-month chart of Airbnb&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168dda954973a34ed556c3e_11%20Img%20-%204.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="stock growth after IPO date photo"></div></figure><p>If you had held the stock for 10 days from the beginning, you would have had +17%. If you had held it for 3 months, you would have had 50%.&nbsp;</p><p>Or use another pattern to speculate within a day. Look at the chart of the first day after the IPO of Snowflake.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168ddb4fa4cd93d4abac058_11%20Img%20-%205.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="IPO growth in a day photo"></div></figure><p>It’s unlikely that you bought the company right at the beginning because there are already a lot of bids. But you could have bought it a little later (1) and sold it that day at point 2. Then you would have around 12% in just one day!</p><p>If you think I found a rare example to persuade you, that’s not true. It’s a very common pattern in many IPOs. Here’s one of the more recent examples—Coursera. The price went +36% in 3 days.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168ddc0fa4cd98aedbac05b_11%20Img%20-%206.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Coursera IPO photo"></div></figure><p>Find the recent IPOs in Gainy and see which companies have gone public.

Most of the time they grow, but there are always exceptions, otherwise the market would be too predictable.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s why our analysts have checked all of them and made professional comments in Gainy on prospects of the company to help you make up your mind.&nbsp;<br>One thing. If you invest in IPOs, don’t do it with all your money, ok? Don’t forget about rebalancing positions.&nbsp;<br></p><h3><strong>3. </strong>Lastly, we’ll talk about <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> as another way to earn money fast</h3><p>Regular volatility of cryptocoins can be as much as 5-10% a day. And in the long run it could be x5, x10, x20.<em> Disclaimer: very high risk to lose money, so choose reliable trading platforms and invest little money.&nbsp;</em></p><p>There are 2 ways to start: hard and easy.&nbsp;</p><p>The hard way is to learn more about technical analysis so that you understand the drawing below (1). The easy way is to buy top-10 coins and hold them. The volatility and diversification will do the rest for you. You just need to check the portfolio from time to time and sell coins that grew (2).</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168e01096eea5dbe4dc52f1_11%20Img%20-%208.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="bitcoin cryptocurrency trading photo"></div></figure><p>Don’t be put off by the prices of cryptocurrencies, you can buy fractions as little as you like. So you can buy 100 different coins at&nbsp; 1 dollar each.&nbsp;<br></p><p>I would also mention that the easiest and safest way is to use Gainy recommendations but we are in the process of development and adding crypto. In Gainy we want to cover all financial assets and give you the best recommendations.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Although this is the end of the basic course, I’m not saying goodbye to you.

Your portfolio will survive all the turbulent times and earn you some good money. Are you ready to become a cutting-edge trader?&nbsp;<br></p><p>Today we will discuss how to choose the best social media stocks for your portfolio.<br></p><h2>Why invest in social media stocks?<br></h2><h3>1. IT and AI markets are growing every day.&nbsp;</h3><p>Leading social media stocks are gaining up to 40% in a year making social media businesses one of the most profitable and desirable for traders. Pandemic brought us long Zoom-sessions and an understanding even in the digitally conservative countries that social media are platforms for all kinds of communication that may exist in our society. During the lockdown, people used social media as online stores, chat rooms, platforms where we play, watch and even date. It’s clear now, that most of the pandemic-brought changes will stay up.</p><h3>‍2. Social Media Industry is not about entertainment anymore.&nbsp;</h3><p>10 years ago most of the existing social networks were tools for killing the time and finding your classmates and relatives. Now, platforms as Instagram became full-functioning business tools where services and goods are bought and sold. Many online businesses depend on a particular network which makes them vulnerable at some point but brings additional growth to well-known social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Market research has shown that more than half of people younger than 30 tend to buy and order things through social media platforms. The potential of Social Media Advertising is growing all over the world as well as the price of the best social network stocks in the financial market.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61ad97dabd83942c83cf82a8_15%20Img%20-%202.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h3>3. Long-term investment opportunities.&nbsp;</h3><p>These companies not only invest in the core business but also in the new niches, for example, Facebooks invests in VR, Pinterest in AI, etc. The long term trend for digitalization will continue to dominate across markets and it would be irrational to ignore it and not add any IT companies to your portfolio. Gainy will help to choose the best social media stocks to invest in because we also care for your long-term perspectives.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Let’s start from top social media stocks in 2021<br></h2><h3>Pinterest </h3><p>A highly visual social network finally made its jump into the e-commerce related field. Revenue growth was reported as $485 billion and the predicted 117% growth in the upcoming year. Worth buying? For sure. In 2020 Pinterest success was highly rated on Wall Street, and the pandemic hasn''t bypassed the company''s success yet. &nbsp; The main idea of this social network is the creation of boards with pictures. Now, in a partnership with Shopify, you may not only add a photo of "new wardrobe" into your board but click on it and buy it from a partner store which attracted more users.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Consider non-trivial options: the social media field is a huge one, and it''s got a variety of companies worth considering investing in.&nbsp;</p><h3>Match Group </h3><p>It is well-known for Tinder and other subscription-based apps where most revenue comes from the paid options inside the app rather than ads and the company founded by their former executive Bumble that we know for the Badoo app. Even Bumble is much smaller than Match group; they grew the paid user base up to 15% and boosted the revenue up to 31% for a year, making it an exciting candidate for investor portfolio. A good social media stock to buy right now!&nbsp;<br>We''ve reached the point when we can discuss giants as Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Facebook </h3><p>It would be an obvious stock to consider simply since you probably have WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook itself installed on your phone, and most likely, you use it every day. CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of Facebook is also impressive - 42%, which means that company is getting more and more profitable over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div></div><h4>How did the lawsuits affect your decision to buy Facebook stock?&nbsp;</h4><p>The main con of buying a share is the latest antitrust allegations and a future lawsuit, which mainly affected the US market as one of the largest for Facebook, it would slow the company''s growth. However, Facebook will not go anywhere anytime soon, and it will remain a stable-growing company for upcoming years. It is also worth saying that Facebook Messenger reached one billion users in 4.9 years while it took YouTube 8.1 years.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61ad97bcc42ed65cd8acbae0_15%20Img%20-%201.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h3>Twitter</h3><p>Another giant, Twitter, also lost points in the scandal by blocking accounts due to political reasons. Do we still consider Twitter the right choice to invest in? Elon Musk and Michelle Obama still actively post there, the idea to buy Clubhouse remains, and generally, yes, Twitter will not also go anywhere, and 13% CAGR is a good confirmation of that. Also, Twitter is becoming one of the big social media in terms of B2B business and more and more comapanies prefer to make main announcments there. Also, giant companies now pass Twitter from social media departments to public relations departments which make this app a very niche one and what it would mean for us - stable in terms of profit and growth.&nbsp;</p><h3>Snapchat</h3><p>It is one more option worth considering. Even CAGR is 45% which is as strong as Facebook, but with the appearance of TikTok on the stage, which took the lead in the spread of the viral content, the positions of Snapchat among teenagers and young adults will weaken. However, some excellent new additions such as augmented reality improvements and the fact that more than a billion snaps are being recorded make the company a long-term player. While the US and Europe have fun in TikTok, Snap hit 100% of year-to-year growth in India and thinks this market is the best for monetization tools and new features growth. Considering its high volatility, Snap is also in the list of best social media stocks for traders as it flies up and down 20% quite often.<br></p><p>One more idea to expand your portfolio is investing in social media stocks of Asian companies.

One more company worth considering is <strong>Tencent</strong>, telecom and media conglomerate which runs the most prominent messenger and social platform app in China - WeChat that has about 1 billion active users monthly.

Gainy — a stock picking and portfolio analyzing app made by professional traders.', 'Bull Market vs Bear Market: Comparison of Investing Strategies 🕵️‍♀️', '<p>As an investor, the first thing to be aware of is the holy stock market lifecycle.&nbsp;</p><p>This simple knowledge will save you from waking up one morning seeing half of your stock in red color and pulling your hair out calling your financial advisor. Financial cycles are important, and you need to always keep in mind your main goals as an investor.&nbsp;</p><p>So, let’s turn to the US Security and Exchange Commission and their bull and bear market definition.</p><p><strong>Bull market:</strong> A time when stock prices are going up, and everyone looks optimistic to market growth. Generally, a bull market occurs when there is a rise of 20% or more in a broad market index over at least a two-month period.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bear market:</strong> A time when stock prices are going down, and sentiment on the market is pessimistic. Generally, a bear market occurs when a broad market index falls by 20% or more over at least a two-month period.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>How do you know if it’s a bear or bull market?</h2><p>If you see the major indexes growing for several months or more - this is considered a bullish market vs a bearish one - where you see a decline in indexes.&nbsp;</p><p>A bull market is a time of long-term investments, in the situation of a growing economy when there is no need to stress that much. However, it’s time to build a diversified portfolio that will remain stable even in bear market times. If your goal is long-term, for example, you’re investing decades ahead to provide yourself with a proper retirement allowance, you must consider that your portfolio will probably go through all the stages of the economic cycle, and it should not scare you.&nbsp;Each period has opportunities for investors.</p><p>To sum up, the bull market is growing and roaring while the bear market is slow and stagnating. Typically, the bear market times are tightly connected to a state of recession such as the 2008 crisis, for example. It’s unlikely that you miss out on information about the start of the new bear market lifecycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Bull vs Bear market: a closer look<br></h2><p>First, it is important to identify which part of the economic cycle we are in. A smart investor knows better than believing panic in news. We look at the numbers when defining bullish vs bearish market. These are the three main ratios that help us to analyze the economic cycle:</p><p><strong>▶️GDP.</strong> You probably know what GDP is. Real Gross Domestic product is one of the indicators that affect the market. Rising GDP means that the economy is growing: more products, more jobs, and much more money spent. Bull market = growing GDP, people buy and sell goods and services, new companies open due to the increased demand. Falling GDP is a sign of a decrease in consumer purchasing power. Less money is spent, the market doesn’t grow, and it means that we’re headed for a bear market.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>▶️Unemployment rates.</strong> This factor is one of the metrics that investors may miss in the analysis. if the business doesn’t grow, there is a decline in the number of workplaces (bearish market alert), if there are enough opportunities in the growing market—more people are needed to make it work which is a sign of a bullish market.&nbsp;</p><p>‍<strong>▶️ CPI</strong>. The Consumer Price Index is one of the indicators of the bear and bull market period: the ratio shows the change in price for a group of goods that consumer buys. This ratio shows the inflation best and if you see these numbers growing it is a sure sign of upcoming bear times. This index is frequently criticized by the economists but as an investor you do not need the exact percentage or perfectly counted ratio: the dynamic is the most important part. Altogether with other ratios mentioned further in the article, it may give you the full picture of bear versus bull market situation and the position of the particular company.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, it seems to be clear: when we’re in the time of a bull market—we sell, we buy, and we invest.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing is, when is the bull market and what do we do in times when we know that a bear market is around the corner?<br></p><h2>Where are we now? Bulls vs Bears in a time perspective </h2><p>The pandemic and the economic war between China and the US, one more Middle Eastern political collapse, and many factors that may influence the current situation. However, we’re still in a bull market when we can watch the fast growth of the companies revenues.&nbsp;<br>‍</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/617bf1f756c37c997ee17e86_cZMxNkZIuex-LPSFdwLzcwzTrwxhDuS5i7lj-hywcnMdfS3W2IVb4J4O6BaCxc5B0EpOqpFVubqyELQv5pZui3cat-Cbe7cAQlUIYsvDdcW3Vr8UjYGyDBeGuv6dJJE21I7gvvhn.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" alt="S&P500 Bear markets and recoveries photo"></div></figure><p>From this graph, you may see that the longest bear period was 31 months, which is 2.5 years and the pandemic caused only 1 month of a bearish market. It is not long enough to panic but it is long enough to reconsider your strategy and use this time wisely.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, we are one step away from the stagflation period, which is characterized by slow growth of the economy in combination with inflation. It’s got bearish tendencies and that’s why some bear market investment strategies will work for you now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One of the main outcomes: do not wait for extremes, watch the tendencies and change your bulls and bears trading strategies wisely. </strong></p><div></div><h2>Is it better to buy in a bear market vs bull market?&nbsp;</h2><p>In both. Your investing strategy may differ as well as your behavior in bear vs bull market, but it does not mean you should stop buying and selling and quit the idea of investing. Each stage of the cycle has its own advantages as well as each company may have its unique way in the given period.&nbsp;</p><p>✅ Advice for all times: have a plan and stick to your goals but be open to new opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>The stock market is not a place for compulsive buying. If you know your goals and you’ve got a plan, parts of the economic cycle will become your friends, not enemies.&nbsp;Reading bull vs bear meaning is not enough to take measures to protect your portfolio, so let''s get to practical advices. </p><p><strong>▶️A bearish market is a time of reliable and stable tools like certificates of deposits, treasury bills, even real estate, because your first goal is to save. A bearish investor is a cautious investor. Not a scared one though.</strong></p><p>Gold is not always a piece of good investment advice, but in a bear market, we say yes to commodities and gold.&nbsp;</p><p>From a long-term perspective, it is a high time to buy underpriced shares of companies that are suffering from the bearish times but will soon recover. Remember, that even stocks of companies with great performance may fall, the decline may be used as a good entry point. Make sure your portfolio is diversified enough and has all the stable tools, which will allow you to get some of the volatile shares.&nbsp;<br></p><p>For example, during the pandemic, all the airlines suffered without business. The share prices dropped because nobody knew how long the situation would last. Optimistic bear investors used this moment to buy some underpriced stocks at that moment. However, the interesting thing is that what was a bear run for some companies, especially transport and tourism, was a bull run for IT and AI companies such as Zoom or Amazon that significantly grew over the pandemic times.&nbsp;</p><p>Do not panic sell during the bear period, especially in the beginning. Think twice: analyze the company numbers and think whether you may regret selling this share after it recovers.&nbsp;</p><p>▶️ <strong>A bullish market is a time of shares and even crypto. It’s the time when we expect growth, and we aim for it. It’s the time of more demand than supply.</strong></p><ul><li>It’s a time when after some analysis it’s smart to invest in young companies that are predicted to grow. However, you shouldn’t rush into this expecting a boost to your portfolio. During a bullish market, the growth is fast and some failures follow shortly.</li><li>It’s easier to try different strategies and short-term investments. Taking profit from ups and downs, regular intervals will help to find the best entering and selling points.</li><li>Time to diversify your portfolio combining young and well-performing companies, shares, and exchange-traded funds.

Check Tesla below:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61698e9b1d300729d973b455_08%20Img%20-%205.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Tesla PE high photo"></div></figure><p>It would take it 397 years to justify its price!</p><p>Demand drives the prices and Tesla seems to be in demand because many people expect the company to start generating profits and paying for itself, but that may not happen. For example, it took Amazon 10 years to start making money, Tesla started to generate profits only this year. Last year P/E was more than 1000 years!&nbsp;</p><p>If P/E is low it means that the company is undervalued and has the potential to grow up to the P/E of its competitors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Companies with low P/E are more attractive.&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><em>NB. Sometimes the company isn’t generating earnings due to a crisis, it’s a new company or it’s specific to an industry. Think about biotechnological startups - many of them spend millions for R&amp;D for years until they discover a cure, formula or get a patent. In this case, P/E will be unavailable and instead you can use EV/S (Enterprise Value / Sales). </em></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61686641b23cfb71a0e61c30_T62UvHy8vPUBaXKty7Xh68YPRqsCd7x4puDeZKVmovghOQnlob7cZszQBr7ymCv7EFDtoEG7QGujaSD2HG5YPtEPeKTtPnLYLn91I5xnhaALF0E333UHO0AfIHXzChg0aqG6Embq%3Ds0.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" alt="additional multiples EV/S photo"></div></figure><p>‍<strong><em> The smaller the better.</em></strong><br></p><h3><strong>Step 2.2. Compare P/E with the sector average</strong><br></h3><p>Overestimation/undervaluation of an individual company can be understood by comparing it with the sector average. The average is shown in the table below. For companies in the real estate, technology and healthcare sectors, P/E is very high. For energy and finance, vice versa.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61698ea974b9882474b187cf_08%20Img%20-%207.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>So if you find a company with a P/E lower than the industry average, it has the potential to grow at least to the average value.&nbsp;</p><p>Task: Find Intel’s P/E using Gainy.

Which one is more attractive to invest in?</p><p>Obviously, the first. It costs less (P/E 11 years vs 37) and earns more (EPS $4.5 vs $2.84), so the first company is more attractive. I won’t tell you the company, but if you’ve done your homework, you will find it ;)<br></p><p>These are just two of the available metrics.

The sector accounts for around 10% of the US economy. If a company’s product has anything to do with technology, that company is probably a part of the tech industry. The US tech sector includes companies with the largest market capitalizations in the world, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.</p><p>The tech market experienced a selloff due to a recent peak, that’s why many stock prices are showing a downward trend. This doesn’t mean this trend will continue long-term and can be viewed as a good opportunity to buy technology stocks now.</p><p>So let’s talk about how to invest in tech companies, what are some of the best technology companies to buy now and how to choose the best ones for you.</p><h2>12 Best Public Tech Companies to Invest in<br></h2><p>Deciding what to invest in is not a simple question. Articles like “Best Tech Companies to Invest in” or “Biggest Tech Companies on the Stock Market” are very common. But we believe that there is no such thing as best for everyone.</p><p>The stock market is a bit like a grocery store. If three different people go to a store to buy food for breakfast, you will end up with different carts: one likes bacon and eggs, someone else might get avocado toast and salmon, and the third will get cereal. To all of them it will be the <em>best breakfast</em>, but it will be different in each case.</p><p>Gainy is an attempt to step away from the mentality of “top 10 best stocks for everybody” and more towards a personalized approach, taking into account a person’s goals, level of psychological risk that’s acceptable to them and their interests.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, you need to believe in a business to invest into them, you need to be at least somewhat interested in their activity and what’s happening to the company.</p><p>Your investment goals are also important, because some companies will provide reliable gains over a long period of time and some grow fast but are more likely to fail.</p><p>So here are some of the best tech companies to invest in, as far as we can see now.<br></p><h2>FAANG Stocks: Best for Conservative Investors</h2><p>Five of the most popular US tech giants are commonly referred to as FAANG: Facebook aka Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google aka Alphabet. Now that both Google and Facebook changed their names, these stocks might as well be called MAAAN. These companies are some of the largest tech companies to invest in. They are leaders in their industries with nearly $7 trillion of combined market capitalization. These companies are also very profitable. These companies’ stocks are the closest you get to a 100% guarantee of long-term growth and are some of the top tech companies to invest in.</p><p>Even though they are laced in controversy and ethical issues characteristic of large corporations, these companies have strong positions in their respective markets and all of them appear to be too big to fail.</p><h3>Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)</h3><p>The largest corporation in the world that needs no introduction is definitely one of the best technology companies to invest in. Even Warren Buffett owns 5% of Apple even though he doesn’t like tech stocks. Apple was the first US company to surpass the $1 trillion market cap mark in 2018. The business generates half of its revenue from iThis-time-we''ve-changed-everything aka iPhone that barely changes over the years, yet the brand''s marketing is so strong everyone wants to get the new one. Even though iPhone sales have slowed down in recent years, in Q3 2021 Apple recorded $17.5 billion in revenue from subscriptions to its services such as iCloud storage, Apple Music and subscription apps, up 33 percent from the same quarter last year.</p><h3>Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) </h3><p>The company that turned from an online bookstore into an immense corporation that owns a third of the Internet through Amazon Web Services (AWS). This is a company that is so into cutting costs their chief cowboy-spaceman Bezos used to work on a table made from a door and they are famous for not wasting any extra money on unnecessary costs like taxes.</p><h3>Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) </h3><p>Alphabet generates the majority of its revenue through Google—the synonym for searching for something online. Every time someone googles something, Google makes money through ads, which brought them $147 billion in 2020, 80% of their total revenue of $183 billion. Google is very efficient at implementing new services and is not shy to *borrow* functionality from other apps, sometimes eating up whole businesses in doing so. Remember Foursquare? Not so much of a thing anymore since Google started offering reviews in Maps. Still use Microsoft Word much? No? We thought so. Google is great at creating a universe around users by offering top quality free services that people use every day. They also own YouTube of course. And they manage businesses in AI and lots of exciting new technologies. All of this and more make Google one of the best technology companies to invest in.</p><h3>Meta (NASDAQ: FB)</h3><p>No matter the kind of controversy it may be caught in, and what Mark Zuckerberg is promising to follow up on with the Congress this time, Facebook, now Meta, still remains the largest social network with 2,8 billion active users. They also own WhatsApp and Instagram and all these users bring them billions in revenue through advertising. Their revenue has grown by 211% in the last 5 years.</p><p>Meta is investing heavily into AI technology, virtual reality and their metaverse, which could bring them more billions in the future. FB stock is currently in a dip, which likely means it’s a decent time to buy this stock, because the company will probably be alright over time.</p><h3>Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)</h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Some will say Netflix is not a tech company but an entertainment company. Even though CEO Reed Hastings has said so himself, the largest movie streaming company relies heavily on fast Internet connection, cloud computing and advanced recommendation system (hey that’s a little like Gainy). And even though they have competitors like Hulu and HBO that could potentially take a big share of their market, Netflix is likely to remain a strong player in the field exactly because they were the ones that figured out how to use technology to sell entertainment in this way. Which may as well be one of the best tech companies to invest in since <em>winter is coming</em> xoxo.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/618e747230627150dd30c3e7_table%201%20-%20FAANG.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><div></div><h2>Best for Value Investors</h2><p>One approach to investing is to pick stocks that are undervalued. Value investors tend to look for stocks that are cheap in comparison to the company’s actual value, hoping that it will rise faster and yield more profits. This is Warren Buffett’s favourite approach to investing.</p><p>A useful metric for finding out cheap tech stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This measures a company''s earnings in relation to their share price. You can read more about the P/E ratio and other useful metrics <a href="https://www.gainy.app/blog/how-to-pick-stocks-part-1-fundamental-analysis">in this article</a>.</p><p>Here are some stocks with relatively low P/E ratios (12 months trailing):</p><h3>HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) </h3><p>Hewlett-Packard is a relatively old company for the tech sector, founded in 1939. HP makes computers, printers, displays and provides a range of services. The company operates in 170 countries worldwide. In July 2021, HP announced their plan to acquire Teradici, a company that specializes in remote computing. HP’s P/E ratio is 8.6.</p><h3>Arrow Electronics (NYSE: ARW) </h3><p>Arrow is a provider of electronic components and computing solutions to enterprises. They are also a distributor of a range of electronic components such as batteries, displays, sensors, and memory. The company''s P/E ratio is 10.2.</p><h3>Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) </h3><p>Intel is a major manufacturer of computer components like processors, chipsets, memory and storage, server products and more. Intel is actively working with traditional as well as new technologies like 5G networks, cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence and autonomous driving. Intel’s P/E ratio is 12.1.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/618e74eadaeb15bd4d2aaa54_table%202%20-%20value%20stocks.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="table with company info for value stocks - photo"></div></figure><h2>Best for Futurists: 5G and AI</h2><p>Tech companies are often actively engaged in the most current technologies, because that’s what will bring them profits in the future. Some companies are famous for particular interest in new fields, like 5G and AI. These may be some of the top tech companies to watch in the near future. If these new fields of tech excite you, these may be some of the best tech companies to buy stock in.</p><h3>NVIDIA (NASDAQ:&nbsp;NVDA)</h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Famous for being a manufacturer of graphics processors (GPUs) originally designed for computer graphics, the technology turned out to be very useful for new technology fields that made NVIDIA a big player in cryptocurrency mining, AI and 5G. In fact, NVIDIA is so trendy they have a solution called "AI-on-5G."</p><h3>Qualcomm (NYSE: QCOM) </h3><p>As a producer of hardware and for wireless networks, such as 4G, 5G and Wi-Fi, the company has over 140,000 existing or pending patents it licenses to organizations around the world. Qualcomm is showing high growth and high revenue and has recently acquired Veoneer, a Swedish company that specializes in advanced driver assistance systems. Which means the future is near and also it looks like a great stock to buy.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/618e74f661710d69f1fb7a81_table%203%20-%205G%20and%20AI.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="table with company info for futurist stocks - photo"></div></figure><h2>Best for Blockchain Enthusiasts</h2><p>Ok, some will say the best thing for blockchain enthusiasts is just to buy Bitcoin. But there are some tech large companies that are heavy investors in blockchain technology. These are just a couple of great tech companies to watch in this field.</p><h3>Square Inc. (NASDAQ: SQ) </h3><p>Square is a mobile payments company led by Jack Dorsey of Twitter who is a big believer in blockchain technology. In addition to owning $400 worth of Bitcoin, the company is developing a decentralized exchange. The company recently reported a quarterly profit of $1.14 bn, 91% higher than last year and is probably one of the best new tech companies to invest in.</p><h3>Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) </h3><p>AMD&nbsp;is Intel’s main rival in computer processors with around a third of the processor market. They are actively involved with developing new blockchain technology, which heavily relies on processing power.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/618e75049922e98424275b74_table%204%20-%20blockchain.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="table with company info for blockchain stocks - photo"></div></figure><h2>How to Analyze &amp; Invest in Tech Companies?</h2><p>Let’s look at some important things that matter when looking at potential investments. Analyzing tech companies is no different from analyzing companies in any other sector. The tech market is divided into industries: consumer electronics, software, semiconductors and so on. Buying stocks of industry leaders is usually a good idea, that’s why FAANG stocks are some of the most popular investments in the world. Look for signs like good news about company development, new partnerships and so on.</p><p>We’ve already mentioned market capitalization and the P/E ratio. Companies with large market cap ($10 billion and more) are usually more reliable investments.</p><h3>Choose companies with relatively low price-to-earnings ratio</h3><p><strong>‍</strong>It''s best to compare this with other companies in the field. This ratio means the trading price for their stocks is low in relation to the company’s earnings. You can read more about the P/E ratio and other metrics in <a href="https://www.gainy.app/blog/how-to-pick-stocks-part-1-fundamental-analysis">this article on fundamental analysis</a>.</p><h3>Choose what you understand</h3><p><strong>‍</strong>It’s best to invest in businesses and industries you understand best. It’s best not to risk investing in something you don’t understand. If you don’t know anything about AI, neuronet or the multiverse, do your research. The reason Warren Buffett doesn’t invest in tech stocks is because he knows he doesn’t understand them enough. Incidentally, he still owns 5% of Apple. Conversely, it’s a good idea to invest in the products you choose and believe in, whether it’s an Apple phone, a Tesla car or an HP laptop.</p><h3>Strong revenue</h3><p><strong>‍</strong>How much money a company is making is a much more important metric of a company’s success than its stock price. When a company’s sales are high that means it’s doing the right things and the market responds favorably. If the company’s revenue has been growing consistently over the past few years, that’s an even better sign of future growth. In fact, if a company’s revenue is high with a low stock price, this can be the best opportunity to buy its shares.</p><h3>Strong cashflow</h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Aside from revenue, cashflow is the amount of money moving in and out of a company. This is also a measure of good performance and shows good liquidity, which means a company is popular on the market and is more likely to be able to pay off its debts.<br></p><p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p><p><strong>✅ Look at industry leaders first</strong></p><p><strong>✅ Choose stocks with low P/E</strong></p><p><strong>✅ Consider past performance</strong></p><p><strong>✅ Choose what you know and understand</strong></p><p><strong>✅ Look at company’s revenue and cashflow</strong><br></p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Hopefully this article gave you some ideas for good tech companies to invest in. These are some of the best publicly traded tech companies. But the truth is there is no such thing as investments that will suit everybody. When you read an article like top 10 best companies to invest in in October, all this means is it may be a good time to buy those stocks <em>right now</em>, but that list can and will change like a cat’s mood because the financial markets are hectic and can be easily manipulated by big players. Furthermore, the majority of those trades are automatic and are more to do with trading than investment.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole tech sector is experiencing a downturn so it''s important to look at the performance of individual companies against what’s happening in the industry overall. If a company’s stock price is lower than usual, this doesn’t necessarily mean they’re not a good investment. “Buying the dip” is a common strategy for traders and it can increase your returns by a few percent.</p><p>A good place to start is to invest into major tech companies. But keep up with the news and find out about the most interesting tech startup companies that exist. The largest and most successful businesses of today were all startups once, and it’s a good idea to look at some small tech companies to invest in.</p><p>The most important thing is what investments are good in the long-term, and the tech sector provides many opportunities for investors. It all depends on your investment goals, such as expected return, volatility and risks. It’s also good to base your investments on your personal interests, and Gainy can help you with that, with personalized lists like best tech companies to buy.</p><h2>FAQ<br></h2>', 'The technology sector is made up of businesses that sell products and services such as electronics, computers, software, communications, cloud technology, AI, and other related businesses.', 'Person_6042277873d29f6a6781fd3d', '2022-01-31T14:51:12.520Z', '4.8', '38', '[]', 'where-to-invest-top-12-tech-companies-on-the-market', 'Want personalized investment recommendations on the best tech stocks that fit your portfolio?

You open the app...and get lost. There are thousands of companies, millions of shares, hundreds of ratios and indexes and you have no idea where to start. We’ve got some great news: you do not have to spend days analyzing each index of every single company you see to make a successful purchase. In this article we will describe an algorithm that will help you to become a pro in finding a company for investment. Let’s take a closer look to find out how to research stocks to buy.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Research Stocks for Beginners?</h2><p>One of the most important things is to identify your goals and make your portfolio diversified.&nbsp;<strong>One of the main rules of investment is to trust in what you buy</strong>. If you’re a true geek and you love technology, while researching a stock to buy,&nbsp;keep IT startups in mind. If you are a green person and you want to contribute to saving our planet, go for it. Your beliefs and ideas should align with your investments: it is important that you enjoy reading the latest company news and watch the numbers. Ideally, you know the market and you’re aware of the latest trends and discoveries in this field.&nbsp;</p><p>So let’s say you’re fond of the sustainability topic and you want to research stocks to buy the best green power company. Solar energy or green transportation—you decide. Let’s discuss how to research a stock before you buy one.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s say you picked two companies and now you have to identify which one is worth buying. In your stock market research this step is one of the most important. Let’s take Tesla—number one in green transportation (and yes, we all love Elon!) and something less obvious, for example, the company First Solar, one of the big players in Solar energy systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Before diving deep into the world of numbers and indexes, let’s answer a few simple questions.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is their business model? </h3><p>Is it transparent enough? In the case of many Asian companies, for example, there are many political factors and risks involved. Also, be aware of single-person companies where all of the profits are the outcome of one man''s charisma because it implies the risk of him or her leaving the company. While researching stocks to buy look at the company’s performance during the latest crises. Some companies that tended to be conservative easily adapted to the new reality and canadd value to your portfolio.&nbsp;</p><h3>What makes them unique? </h3><p>For example, we all know what makes Tesla unique. Considering investment opportunities first we think of outstanding companies that are widely known for their advantages. In the case of Solar First, what can be more in demand in the 21st century than solar panels?&nbsp;</p><h3>Who owns it? </h3><p><strong>‍</strong>When you evaluate a company, do not forget that changes in management may be dramatic and directly influence a company''s numbers. For example, First Solar had hard times when many companies opened up cheap manufacturing in China, but they survived the competition and doubled their capacity. They are stable and growing now. However, if you’re not a conservative investor, there are many promising startups in the industry worth considering.&nbsp;</p><h3>What has to happen for this company to go bankrupt? </h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Death of a leader, war or a new pandemic? Do not be afraid to think of the craziest scenarios and try to imagine which company will most likely survive the storm if you’re aiming for long-term investments.&nbsp;</p><p>If you''re a short-term investor, think about what needs to happen for this company to bloom or go bankrupt.&nbsp;</p><p>If according to this first-glance research you still want to invest, let’s move on to the numbers.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are the most important metrics to check when conducting your stock research?</h2><ol start=""><li><strong>Start from the revenue or total amount of income generated.</strong> the best approach is to compare the revenue of different companies in one sector. One of the companies we used for our research of stocks to buy is First Solar. Let’s take one more company from the sector to compare results: Jinkosolar Company.&nbsp;<br>‍<br>The total revenue of First Solar is $2,711B and the total revenue of Jinksolar is $5,09B, which is better. The point is that these numbers don’t say anything if we don''t compare them.&nbsp;<br>‍<strong>‍</strong></li><li>Net Income<strong> </strong>— the main difference from revenue is that this ratio is about profit only. Tesla''s revenue is $31,536B while net income is just $690M.&nbsp;<br>‍</li><li>Now we’re reaching slightly bit less obvious ratios that are still very important when researching stocks. <strong>СAGR is one of the most important parameters for individual investors.</strong> This ratio shows the annual growth of investments over a certain amount of time. So basically, this number will show you the growth of your investments over time.</li></ol><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6197c6a546653d696ab0c2eb_i5khTqpdu1N2aI7DXIHhPDaPr9QFPlhCB27MtBLyoki4VoEjNZYSjGap5OvQjpq82Y2wqYcJElf2HslUl3XoH90gtJoqyYBKDPowBTiOhPvPLbkRHCMeWVjNdSeqy-9LH9pfoAEp.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" alt="Tesla CAGR growth revenue photo"></div><figcaption>For example, Tesla''s 3-year СAGR is 43,98%, which can be considered as a great result.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><ol start="4"><li><strong>Price-to-earnings ratio</strong>. This one lets you identify if a certain stock is overvalued or undervalued. How do we do that?&nbsp;We divide the share price by earnings per share. Or check these metrics in Gainy and compare with those of their competitors. Remember that the higher price-to-earnings ratio, the more overvalued the company is. <br></li></ol><p>This graph shows the price to ratio of Tesla over the last 5 years.</p><p>The last ratios that are important to mention when talking about the best way to research stocks would be ROE and ROA.&nbsp;</p><p>Return on equity (ROE) and Return on assets (ROA) are two important metrics for evaluating the success of a company''s performance, i.e. how well they handle what they have. ROE = Shareholder Equity / Net Income and ​ROA = Total Assets / Net Income. If the company is in huge debt, these indexes will show this. If you did your first-hand research about the company''s management but it is still unclear, this is what you need. These ratios show how the company uses their assets to generate income.&nbsp;</p><p>We love examples. The best way to research stock is to look at real companies’ numbers. The ROE of Tesla is 9.64% and ROA is 0.70%. What is interesting about these numbers? With more than 10B dollar debt the company has negative cashflow numbers and is losing to other auto giants. If you love cars, not only Elon and as an investor, you should be looking for something stable and profitable—German car-makers would be a better decision.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about debt again is one more ratio — Debt-to-EBITDA (EBITDA represents a company''s earnings before taxes, amortization and interests). Debt is usually easy to find in annual reports. What you really need is debt-to-EBITDA — the ratio that shows whether a company is capable of paying its debts. A declining ratio shows that the company pays off their debts. If the number is increasing it means that debt is getting bigger than the amount of income.&nbsp;</p><p>This main research provides a picture of where a particular company stands. However, ratios are not the only important element of how to do stock research. Zoom out and take a look at the whole picture: is this company a good fit for your portfolio? Gainy will help you to build a perfectly balanced one.&nbsp;</p><h2>Where to Research Stocks?&nbsp;</h2><h3>Let’s talk about the best way to research stocks:&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Your own first-hand research.</strong> Never miss this step. If you''ve been reading so far, you already know how to pick a company and which ratios you need to look at first. You do not have to conduct fundamental research to find out the main points. If you like a systematic approach, open a new excel sheet and compare companies in a table writing down all the pros and cons you see. If it seems like too much work to do, use Gainy to find all the important information and track multiples in a convenient and personalized way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stock screeners.</strong> It is one of the best ways how to research a company for stock. There are technical platforms that automatically compare up-to-date company data. Be careful here: you know which ratios you need and do not get confused and overwhelmed by all the numbers you see.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Run your own channel checks. </strong>Watch the trends regularly.</p><p><strong>Newsletters, expert blogs and channels with updates.</strong> Watch the industry and the market. If you’re fond of green technologies and you want to invest in them, make sure you know the main challenges and ideas to be implemented in the industry. You do not have to be a great expert, just be in the flow of the main information so as not to miss any significant things.&nbsp;</p><h2>Final Thoughts </h2><p>Let’s sum it up with a quick exercise using some of the ratios we talked about.</p><p>Let’s take companies from one industry. Remember, that your decision should be based not only on numbers you see but also on what you read in forecasts and industry statistics. For example, if you read about First Solar, you would know about their ambitious project in India that may turn out to be a great success. SunPower showed an impressive Year-over-Year revenue growth of 43%. Both companies are definitely a good choice, however, some of the forecasts and ratios in the table below would be more on FirstSolar''s side.&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6197c1f1f01bcd179239ecaf_IY8OQ12EvXAkd4po9Gn-i2v4-k7lU3oZ6S0QdPjCTfYsdKMVpNpCWhQwObBe_wRajiwNJrEmjVdJMUWcmjFthN-RdOsGRhOvsTMfLaJWGkc2LUs-KbuGagq6EAQNNf4izS88fqir.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" alt="first solar sunpower comparison photo"></div></figure><h2>FAQ</h2>', 'You open the app...and get lost.

In this article, we will answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>What is market value?&nbsp;</li><li>What factors affect the market value of stocks?&nbsp;</li><li>Why should traders monitor the market value of stocks?</li><li>What is the difference between market value and price?</li><li>How is market value determined?</li></ul><h2>What is the Market Value? Definition</h2><p>What is a stock''s market value? Formally, it is the price that investors are willing to pay for an asset. It is determined by considering all sources of its funding: debt obligations, preferred stock, minority interests, and common stock.</p><h2>What is the Market Value of a&nbsp;Company?</h2><p>The market value of a company is the same as the market value of shares. Usually, the number is influenced the most by the potential of a company for investors, considering its profitability, debt, growth prospects, etc.</p><p>It’s important to choose the right method for estimating the market value of a company to eliminate ambiguity in its valuation.</p><p>Usually, buyers and sellers estimate the value of goods differently. Buyers want to pay less, and sellers hope to get more. The main purpose of determining market value is to give a fair estimate of the value or worth of an asset. Simply put, it is the price for which an item would normally be sold for. Buyers have the option to pay, and sellers can accept more or less than the market value.</p><h2>What is a Stock''s Market Value?</h2><p>Stock market value is the price at which shares are bought and sold on the secondary market. Unlike other types of value, stock market value is formed in the process of stock trading. It depends on supply and demand for the stock of a given corporation and is updated daily. In some cases (for example, in stock exchanges terms), a different market value definition is used — quote. You should buy a stock when its quotation falls briefly and sell it when it rises.</p><div></div><h2>Market Value vs. Market Price</h2><p>Price is what you pay, and value is what you get.</p><p>This is perhaps the most fundamental difference between the concepts of market price and value. When you buy a product or stock, you pay a certain market price. Particularly when it comes to stocks, the market price is based on a combination of subjective and objective factors. In fact, you pay the price or market value of a stock. But value is what is in the asset. The value is determined by the value of the stock, which in turn depends on how much cash flow the company can generate in the future.</p><p>There are different criteria and processes of estimating the value of the stock. However, the buyer is primarily interested in earnings prospects, potential dividends, and the company’s financial condition. These three fundamental factors determine the estimated price of the stock since they guide investors, comparing stocks to other investment opportunities available to them.</p><p>Of primary interest to investors is the market value of equity, i.e., the price at which a stock is sold and bought in the market.</p><h2>What Affects the Market Value? 8 Essential Factors</h2><h3>Demand</h3><p>Demand is determined by consumer preferences, which depend on what income this business brings to the owner, at what time, what risks it carries, what opportunities to control and resell this business.</p><h3>Income</h3><p>The income that an owner of a facility can earn depends on the nature of the operation and the opportunity to make a profit on the sale of the facility after it is used. Operating profit, in turn, is determined by the ratio of income and expense streams.</p><h3>Time</h3><p>Of great importance to the formation of the value of the enterprise is the timing of revenue streams. One thing if the owner acquires assets and quickly begins to profit from their use, and it is another matter if the investment and the return of capital are separated by a significant period.</p><h3>Industry Risks</h3><p>The company''s profits may decline in the future, sometimes, unpredictably, negatively impacting its share price. Among widespread risks are competitive threats, product substitution, industry prospects in general, etc.</p><h3>Control</h3><p>One of the most critical factors affecting value is the degree of control that the new owner has.</p><p>If a business is purchased as individual private property, or if a controlling interest is purchased, the new owner has substantial rights such as the right to appoint managers, determine their salaries, influence business strategy and tactics, sell or buy its assets, restructure or even liquidate the business, decide whether to take over other businesses, determine dividends, etc. Because you buy more rights, the value and price are usually higher than when you buy a non-controlling interest.</p><h3>Liquidity</h3><p>One of the most important factors in estimating the market value of a business and its property is the degree of liquidity.</p><p>The market liquidity of assets affects their price and expected return. Investors require higher returns on assets with lower market liquidity to compensate for the higher cost of trading those assets. That is, for an asset with a given cash flow, the higher its market liquidity, the higher its price, and the lower its expected return.&nbsp;</p><h3>Restrictions</h3><p>The value of a business responds to any restrictions the business has. For example, if the government restricts the price of a business''s products, the value of that business will be lower than if there are no restrictions.</p><h3>Supply and Demand Ratio</h3><p>Demand for a business, along with utility, also depends on the solvency of potential investors, the value of money, and the ability to raise additional capital in the financial market. An investor''s attitude toward the level of return and the degree of risk depends even on age. Younger people tend to take more risks for higher returns in the future.</p><h2>Examples of rises and falls in&nbsp;stock prices</h2><ul><li>On March 12, the day after Donald Trump banned travel from Europe to the U.S., U.S. airline stocks reacted to the market situation and dropped significantly in value: United Airlines — almost 16%, Delta Air Lines — almost 15%, American Airlines — 19%, Southwest Airlines — 14.3%.</li><li>Because of the coronavirus situation and unfavorable market conditions, oil and gas companies also suffered enormous losses. The closure of transport links and the shutdown of several production facilities led to a decrease in demand and, consequently, a drop in oil prices. For example, shares of Continental Resources, one of the largest U.S. shale oil producers, fell by 73% over the past three months. Amid the spread of the coronavirus, the company refused to pay a quarterly dividend and said it would cut production by about 30%.</li><li>In the face of self-isolation, many have turned their attention to virtual entertainment, including video games. One of the beneficiaries of this process is Electronic Arts, the largest representative of the gaming industry. Since the beginning of the year, Electronic Arts shares have risen 7% to $114 per share.</li><li>The growing demand for electric cars drives up the price of its largest manufacturer, Tesla. <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-price-outlook-target-wall-street-analyst-goldman-jpmorgan-2020-12">At the very beginning of 2020, Tesla shares could be bought for $84.90</a>, but now the price of one share exceeds $700. Meanwhile, experts believe that Tesla stock hasn''t exhausted its potential and will continue to grow as its share in the electric car market increases.</li><li>Against the background of the U.S. authorities'' decision to allow the sale of tobacco heating systems, iQOS shares of its manufacturer Philip Morris (PM) rose by 2%. The fact is that this position of the government opens a new financial market for PM, which is beneficial to the profitability of the company, and, accordingly, stimulates the growth of the value of their shares.</li><li>Apple''s revenue for its first fiscal quarter of 2019-2020, which ended December 28, 2019, was $92 billion, a record high for the company. The positive report encouraged investors to buy Apple stock, which immediately responded with an increase of about 2%.</li></ul><h2>How to Calculate Market Value?</h2><p>A very common question among investors is how to calculate the market value of a company</p><p>There are several ways to calculate the market value of a firm and market capitalization. This is important for every investor who wants to know if it makes sense to buy or sell a stock.</p><h3>Estimating a company''s value based on its stock price</h3><p>If a company''s stock is already traded on a stock exchange, the easiest way to calculate its market value is to multiply the number of shares outstanding by the current price at which the stock is traded on the relevant exchange. If the shares are only traded on an exchange, the trading volume may be so small that the trading prices are not realistic.</p><h3>Valuing a company by sales multiples</h3><p>A reasonable alternative is to estimate market value for those companies whose trading volume matches their market prices. This latter approach may be fraught with some uncertainty since the more reliable companies may reasonably cost a lot. In that case, the market value is likely to be excessively high.</p><h3>Market valuation company value by comparison companies</h3><p>Another approach to estimating market value is to look at what similar companies sell for as a percentage of their sales and use that ratio to determine the value of the business. The main drawback of this approach is that the best companies are likely to be sold first and therefore get better multiples; companies sold after the first tranche do not perform as well and thus probably should be sold at lower multiples.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>So what does market value mean? Hope we clarified that in the article.

Identifying which companies will have a high payout ratio and which will have a small dividend payout, which industry will be good for dividend investing. Knowing the indicators of a company allows investors to decide which industry or company can be invested in for potentially high earnings in dividends.</p><h2>What is a Dividend Payout Ratio?</h2><p>The dividend payout ratio lets investors figure out if a company can sustain certain dividend payouts over time. The dividend payout ratio formula is a ratio simply calculated by dividing the present dividend payment amount by its earnings per share. Learning to calculate dividend payout ratio is important since it tells investors how much of its earnings a company keeps for itself and how much it is giving its shareholders. Knowing how to determine dividend payout ratio allows experienced investors to build up some awareness about future income potential from a stock.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Purpose of the Dividend Payout Ratio</h2><p>The dividend payout ratio is a helpful tool for comparing dividend stocks. The ratio shows how much of a company''s net income is paid to shareholders through dividends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Please remember that the dividend payout ratio won''t tell you how a company is doing financially. The ratio simply tells how a company is spending its earnings. Knowing a company''s payout percentage<strong> </strong>is particularly useful if your strategy involves investing in dividend stocks to build a passive income stream. These indicators of a company</p><p>is also useful if you are looking to build up your principal by reinvesting dividends.&nbsp;</p><p>Knowing what dividend payout ratio is and how to go about calculating it will be beneficial when planning to make earnings in dividends a part of your portfolio strategy.<em>‍</em></p><p>The dividend payout ratio will differ for different companies across industries. It varies due to unique financial, operational, and investment situations. As investors, we must accept that no two companies'' dividend payout ratios would be the same even in the same sector.</p><p>Older companies that are further on in their life cycle phase will have a high payout ratio as they won''t need to inject as much capital back into the business. This leaves them with the financial capacity to pay more dividends for investors.</p><p>New companies will keep a small dividend payout ratio to retain enough funds for the company’s further growth.</p><div></div><h2>Dividend Payout vs. Dividend Yield</h2><p>The dividend payout ratio tells investors how much of its profit a company is paid to investors. In comparison, the dividend yield tells us the dividend payment per share compared with the market value of the same share. In a way, the dividend yield tells you, the investor, how much you will earn on the amount you spend on a share. Both values have their uses and applications in an investment strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>The Formula For Dividend Yield:<br><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/619e702ef0159d20783cbc64_1%20Dividend%20yield%20formula.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Dividend yield formula - photo" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>The dividend yield gives us an estimate of the earnings in dividends from a stock. If we assume stable dividends, the yield value will increase when the stock price falls. The dividend yield will decline when stock prices rise. This rule is worth remembering since dividend yield can appear attractive, particularly in falling markets.&nbsp;</p><p>This rule is a basic problem with the ratio, and it can trap unaware investors. Even if dividend payouts are generous, investors need to assess if the dividends are at the expense of company expansion and growth. This distortion is why most analysts prefer to use the dividend payout ratio with the dividend yield.</p><p>The DPR is seen as more dependable as it reflects how much of a company''s earnings are being paid out to shareholders. Using both ratios together is strongly recommended.&nbsp;</p><p>However, in some cases, focusing on dividend yield alone is beneficial. In the case of retirees, who need to build up income-generating portfolios, focusing on dividend yields would make sense. Tracking high historical dividend yields would help build up earnings in dividends and allow them to meet their post-retirement expenses. However, it is strongly advisable to use other ratios when building up an investment strategy.</p><h2>Dividend Payout Ratio Formula</h2><p>There are three different ways to do the dividend payout ratio calculation. All will yield the same value when used correctly.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/619e7058469b9f75a617ed80_2%20dpr%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="The formula for dividend payout ratio - photo" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>Retention ratio is the portion of net earnings that a company retains for its internal use.

Using an app like Gainy will reduce time spent searching up values for your calculations and allow you to focus on comparing ratios and stock’s share prices to decide which stocks to add to your portfolio.&nbsp;</p><h2>High and Low Dividend Payout Ratio&nbsp;</h2><h3>How to read ratios</h3><p>What is a low and high ratio? If you compare two stocks and get DPRs of 22% and 25%, which one should you pick? The real question here would be which company can maintain its DPR over time. For instance, if the company with 25% DPR for this year had a DPR of 10% last year and 20% the year before, we can safely assume that it is not in the habit of paying regular dividends.&nbsp;</p><p>If company one has maintained its DPR between 20-22% for the past 3 or 5 years, we can assume that it has a strategy of paying steady dividends. There are some factors to consider in such a case, like the company''s life cycle and industry standards.&nbsp;</p><p>The levels of the DPR depend on a few generic variables, like the maturity of the company, reinvestment or expansion options, sector status.&nbsp;</p><p>Life Cycle: If a company is a new entrant and in the growth phase of its life cycle, it would need to reinvest its earnings into the expansion and development of its market. This need for capital injection would leave it with a small dividend payout to give away in the form of dividends. Usually, new companies scrambling to expand usually pay no dividends for a few years. A prime example is Amazon, which was pouring its earnings back into its operations.&nbsp;</p><p>Expansion Opportunities: at times, established companies come across or start on new projects for further growth, which require capital injection, due to which companies reduce or stop their dividend payments to their shareholders. In these cases, it is a case of waiting it out as the company will resume paying dividends at the level or higher before the project was started.&nbsp;</p><h3>Other Aspects to Consider</h3><p><strong>Trend Maintenance:</strong> The trend of the Dividend Payout Ratio should be maintained year on year. Keeping a stable dividend payout allows the company to retain its reputation as a good dividend issuer. While this doesn''t impact financial or operational performance directly, it builds reputational strength and allows it to attract more potential investors in case of further share issues. Dividend giants like Shell, Colgate Palmolive are prime examples.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rising Dividend Payout trend</strong>: at times, companies aim to increase their dividend payout year on year to reflect their growth and indicate financial and operational strength. In my opinion, this should raise some flags if it is not a norm for the sector. While this should not be a criterion, in some sectors, like Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Master Limited Partnership (MLP), it is a regulatory obligation to payout 90% of profits in dividends to shareholders.&nbsp;</p><h2>Concluding Remarks</h2><p>Along with the industry and maturity stage of the company, it is critical to compare the DPR in the framework of the company, its industry, and its competitors. The DPR will generate many insights when seen from the perspective of its sector and life cycle. Many companies offer shareholders value in other areas comparative to dividend payments. For example, generating cash flows to service and reduce debt will create shareholder value in the long term.</p><p>A key rule of thumb is that if a dividend payout ratio is over 100%, the company is disbursing more cash in dividends than what it is earning through its operations. While it seems great to get so much as a stockholder, this will not be sustainable over a long time if you want to keep the stocks in your portfolio. An improbably high dividend payout ratio should also be taken as a red flag, as at times, companies do this when they are not earning enough but don''t what shareholders to sell their shares.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are many factors and variables to keep in mind when selecting and evaluating stocks for investing. Many apps help investors assess their options based on their investment purposes, capital amount, and risk preferences. Using them allows investors to build up their portfolios with relative ease and save on time and effort.</p><p>Using a failsafe means of selecting stocks helps to reduce investment and portfolio risks. This reduction is simple. Using digital technology helps cut down on human errors and bias in selecting stocks and allows for better and clear decision-making. Automated stock selection based on user specified preferences helps to cut down on errors in stock selection, and evaluation reduces risks to some extent.&nbsp;</p><p>The Gainy app is a prime example of technology helping people.

You will also get acquainted with examples of dividend yield calculations of famous companies and get answers to the most popular questions on the topic.<br></p><h2>So What Is the Dividend Yield?</h2><p>What is the dividend yield? Dividend yield shows the ratio between the most recent dividends paid to investors and the current share price as a key percentage. It depends on the dividends paid and the company’s stock price and shows how high the percentage per share is.&nbsp;</p><p>Why should shareholders know the answer to the question, "What does dividend yield mean?”</p><p>Via the dividend yield, investors can evaluate the profitability of their investment. Dividend yields are subject to fluctuations because they depend on the share price and dividends paid. Note that not every company pays dividends to its shareholders: some companies have never paid dividends and put this in their policy; others may decide to do so because of a challenging market situation (e.g., due to the COVID-19 pandemic).</p><p>How does dividend yield work?&nbsp;</p><p>The very essence of dividends is the right of a shareholder to receive a portion of the company''s profits since a share signifies the investor''s participation in the issuer''s capital. Companies that routinely pay dividends have a distinct advantage for long-term investments. That’s why it’s important for investors to know how dividend yield works.</p><p><strong>Knowing the DY ratio is a must:</strong></p><ul><li>When adding new stocks to your portfolio, to analyze and calculate expected returns.</li><li>When calculating the earnings or payback of existing securities.</li></ul><p>You can calculate the annual dividend yield by dividing the annual payout by the share price. For example, if Chevron''s quarterly dividend payment of $1.19 stays the same throughout 2019, the company will end up paying $4.76 per share in dividends for the year. Chevron stock is trading around $118 apiece. Thus, Chevron''s annualized yield is about 4%.</p><p>That value is well above the 1.9% yield for the S&amp;P 500. A clear understanding of dividend payouts and how they are carried out will help you find a worthy dividend-paying company and increase potential profitability.</p><p>According to Dividend.com, the biggest payouts come from companies that extract and produce raw materials such as oil, gas, metals, chemicals, building materials, timber, or paper products. Financial companies come in second place. They pay an average of 4.96% and 4.18%, respectively. Nevertheless, too high a payout is often a signal that all is not well in a company''s business. Why? By paying large dividends to shareholders, a company may not have the funds left to continue growing. In addition, some companies may lure shareholders with high dividends by offering "junk stock."</p><h2>The Dividend Yield Formula</h2><p>To calculate dividend yield, use the following dividend yield formula:</p><p><strong><em>Dividend yield = Annual dividends paid per share / Price per share</em></strong></p><p>You can also use a dividend yield calculator for this.</p><p><em>Download the Gainy app to find all the important indicators for investors as easily as possible.</em></p><h2>How to Calculate Dividend Yield? Example calculation</h2><p>Stock dividend yield measures the amount of cash flow received from each dollar invested in a stock and is determined by the number of dividends paid on that stock. The dividend yield, calculated as of a particular day, is independent of changes in the market stock price. Dividend investors who wish to receive a periodic return on their investments not only from asset value growth but can also provide it by buying shares of companies with relatively high and stable dividend yields.</p><p>Dividend per share (DPS) is the number of dividends per common or preferred share of a company in dollars.</p><p><strong><em>DPS = NetProfit / NumberOfShares x DPR</em></strong></p><p>Where:</p><ul><li>NetProfit is the company''s net income, part of which is paid out in dividends.</li><li>NumberOfShares is the number of outstanding common or preferred shares of the company.</li><li>DPR (Dividend payout ratio) is the proportion of the company''s net profit, which is used to pay dividends on common or preferred shares.</li></ul><p>What does div/yield mean? Dividend yield (DY) is the return (as a percentage over the holding period, from the date of yield calculation to the date of actual dividend payment) on each dollar invested in common or preferred stock from the payment of dividends by the issuer of that stock.</p><p><strong><em>DY = DPSnet / P0 x 100%</em></strong></p><p>Where P0 is the price of the common or preferred share in dollars on the date the dividend yield is calculated.</p><p><strong>Let’s do an example calculation to understand the div/yield meaning better:</strong></p><p>On May 12, 2016, the closing price per share of Ford Motor Co. on the New York Stock Exchange was $11.70, with an annual dividend of $0.60. Using the formula, we get the yield on the securities on that date: $0.60 / $11.70 * 100% = 5.13%.</p><p>Also, we can estimate the yield for the current year by taking into account the indicator for the last year or by applying the last quarterly yield, multiplying it by 4, and dividing it by the current value of the securities.</p><p>It is worth noting that in the U.S. 3-5% is considered relatively high. U.S. stocks with high yields (above 10%) are traditionally regarded as high-risk.</p><p><strong>How do I know what a good dividend yield ratio is?</strong></p><p>To be a successful investor, it is not enough to know the definition of dividend yield. It is important to remember a few essential criteria that investors should focus on when they choose the dividend strategy:</p><ul><li>Dividend yield over 2.5%.</li><li>Payout history and increase in dividends calculated over 10 years.</li><li>Revenue and earnings per share are growing faster than inflation; otherwise, we are dealing with a stagnant business that will eventually go bankrupt.</li><li>The level of debt is acceptable — you can use the ratings of specialized agencies or analyze the business yourself.</li><li>The share of profits allocated to dividends does not exceed 60%. The company''s profit is one of the sources of its growth and development. If a company spends all of its profits on dividends, it will have to take out loans to expand its business, which is a bad sign.</li><li>This sector covers everything but real estate (REITs) because REIT dividends are always taxed at 30%.</li></ul><p>It is quite normal for the U.S. market to have a low dividend yield. On average, it is about 2-3%. The leaders of the ratings, the so-called "blue chips," show a yield of 5%. The maximum that can be seen is 7%, which should alert a knowledgeable investor: in this way, companies want to increase their attractiveness for investors and therefore may not receive similar interest in the future. But there is also a category of real estate funds (REIT-funds) with a DY of 10%.</p><p>The European market follows roughly the same pattern. For higher dividend yields, consider countries whose economies are at an early stage of development, e.g., Russia. However, do not forget about the risks that are inevitable when investing in companies in such countries.</p><p>Statistics, history, and analytics of foreign companies are publicly available online.</p><p>The top five dividend stocks for 2021 include Best Buy (BBY), one of the largest electronics retailers in the United States; U.S. semiconductor makers Texas Instruments (TXN) and Broadcom (AVGO); JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the No. 1 bank in the United States by asset size; and investment firm T. Rowe Price (TROW).</p><p>All investors want to have good dividend stocks in their portfolios because the resulting stocks dividend yields can be reinvested. The best choice would be companies with a good dividend payout history and a simultaneous rise in their stock price.</p><p>The table below shows that the dividend yield of Best Buy, Texas Instruments, Broadcom, JPMorgan Chase, and T. Rowe Price stocks exceeds 1.5% of the S&amp;P 500 while outperforming the index by five years. That''s a high bar that relatively few stocks meet, especially given the volatility in the market last year.</p><p>To choose the best dividend stocks to buy and hold in 2021, investors need to consider several metrics:</p><ul><li><strong>Dividend payment history</strong> — how long and how consistently has the company been paying dividends to its shareholders?</li><li><strong>Dividend growth</strong> indicates that the company is in good financial health and is working hard to make its stock more attractive to new and existing investors. A company with stable earnings is more likely to pay stable and possibly rising dividends.</li><li><strong>The dividend yield ratio</strong> (dividend per share divided by earnings per share) helps assess whether the dividend is sustainable. A financial ratio exceeding 100% can warn of a possible dividend cut.</li></ul><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Hopefully this article helped you to understand what div/yield is, how to determine dividend yield of stocks, who needs this indicator, and how to calculate dividend yield.</p><p>The truth is, you don’t have to calculate it. <a href="https://www.gainy.app/">Gainy </a>will make your life so much easier.

A stock split is an increase in the number of securities of an issuing company traded on the market at the expense of a decrease in their value for the same capitalization.</p><h2>How does a Stock Split Work?</h2><p>Every investor needs to understand how and when to do a stock split. A stock split, under country-specific laws and market rules, follows the next pattern:</p><ul><li>A proposal for a split is recommended for consideration by the board of directors.</li><li>The shareholders approve the decision to split the securities at the general meeting by a majority vote.</li><li>The board of directors decides to issue additional investment instruments.</li><li>The necessary documentation is submitted to a country''s main bank, and the issue is registered.</li><li>The active securities are converted into the issued securities within the stipulated period.</li><li>The report on the results of the issuance process shall be registered with the Central Bank Financial Markets Service.</li><li>The statutes of the issuing company are amended with regard to the number of investment documents and their nominal value.</li></ul><p>No need to go far to understand why companies split their stock and find stock split examples due to the increase in the value of securities. In 2020, two of the largest and most famous companies, Apple Inc. and Tesla, did stock splits.</p><p>This is the fifth separation of financial instruments for Apple Corporation. The first four occurred in 1987, 2000, 2005, and 2014. This time the proportion was 4:1. What was the purpose of the stock split in this case? This allowed Apple to quadruple the number of shares on the stock market and reduce its price from $400 to $100.This way, the Cupertino company received a double effect of a stock split:</p><ul><li>the price reduction made the paper more accessible and attracted the attention of the mass investor</li><li>the share price now does not stand out as much among other companies in the Dow Jones Index.</li></ul><p>For Tesla, this was the first 5:1 split (recall that its stock had been up about 295% since the beginning of 2020).</p><p>Now you will be able to answer the question: “When a stock splits, what happens?”</p><p>However, you might be interested to know that there are also examples of companies that don''t want to incur the large administrative costs of conducting a stock split and trading over $1,000 worth of stock. These are, for example, Amazon, whose securities averaged more than $3,000 apiece in September 2020, and Alphabet (which controls Google Inc.), about $1,500 per share over the same period. And while Amazon''s management understands why a company splits its stock, they''re not following Tesla''s path anyway.</p><h2>Why does a Company Split its Stock?</h2><p>It''s important to understand that there are different types of stock splits. The most common stock splits are 2-for-1, 3-for-2, and 3-for-1.</p><p>Each developing company is interested in the inflow of additional funds, which directly depends on attracting many investors. But not every trader or even an investment fund can afford to buy the costly shares of a growing company, no matter how promising it might be. Therefore, such a company divides the increased price of its shares by stock split ratios. What is the purpose of a stock split? The number of securities increases, and their proportionally reduced price becomes more attractive to the retail customer.</p><h3>When splitting is carried out</h3><p>The need to split financial instruments usually arises at two stages of a firm''s development:</p><ul><li>Having given up on bank lending, the firm issues financial instruments to aspiring co-owners at a very high price. But then, due to the need for additional capital investment, it has to issue securities for trading on the stock exchange. Consequently, a stock split must be applied for the initial sale of securities to the general public (IPO).</li><li>Provided the issuing company is constantly growing and developing, the value of its securities will also continuously increase, which will eventually also push the split to make the shares more attractive and accessible to a broader audience of investors.</li></ul><h3>Why does a stock split occur?</h3><p>When and how does a stock split work? There is an opinion that stocks are just like any other commodity. Therefore, the stock price must be "convenient," that is, available to the mass investor. If you have $1000, it is psychologically more pleasant to buy 10 shares for $100 than 1 share for $1000. In the former case, you are the owner of a "batch of securities,” while in the latter case, you own just one share. And when you consider that stocks are often sold in batches of many shares at once, becoming an investor at a high single share price will be problematic.</p><div></div><p>Issuers often take the decision to split securities. Some firms do this more than once in the history of their public existence, realizing all benefits of a stock split. But there are also those who fundamentally refuse the splitting procedure.</p><p>The most striking example is Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Warren Buffett. Now one security is worth $340,262. Thus, the owner makes it clear that he is not interested in the influx of numerous private investors, who are often involved in speculating on the stock market. Berkshire Hathaway positions itself as a company for serious and long-term investors, and the company does not see reasons for a stock split. Each buyer is seen as a partner and owner of part of W. Buffett''s business.</p><p>So far, the same policy has been followed by Amazon. True, the price of the paper is much lower than that of Berkshire Hathaway: it costs $3,172. But even this sum is not affordable to every private investor.</p><h3>Consolidation of shares: What is it, and why is it needed?</h3><p>In investing, there is a procedure that is the reverse of a stock split: stock consolidation. It increases their value and decreases their number. It is most often done when a company wants to meet the requirements of a particular stock exchange. For example, Nasdaq can delist an instrument if its value stays at $1 for a month.</p><p>The consolidation procedure is less reliable than the separation procedure. A decline in value that requires an increase in the asset price could indicate problems in the company. The investor wonders why the stock is not in demand in the stock market or why it is actively selling off. They draw their own conclusions and start selling securities too, causing an even bigger collapse.</p><h2>How Stock Splits Affect Investor Returns?</h2><p>We’ve contemplated what a stock split means. It''s time to consider the benefits of stock splits for investors.</p><h3>Stocks become more affordable</h3><p>Usually, a stock split on the chart (optical price movement) causes the price to fall.</p><p>In a 1:2 stock split, where two new shares are issued for one old share, the face value and market value are suddenly halved, leading inexperienced investors to believe that the price has dropped by 50%.</p><p>What is the result of a stock split? The number of shares increases, their price drops, and they become more affordable for investors; however, the total value of the shares remains intact as a stock split doesn’t influence it.</p><h3>Stock splits can contribute to positive price development</h3><p>What happens when stocks split? Stock splits can contribute to positive stock price development, but not necessarily. Consequently, it should not be assumed that such a move will automatically positively affect price development.</p><p>The mere announcement of a stock split is not in itself a reason to buy. In most cases, one can assume that a stock split will attract new investors, but before buying, be sure to analyze the company’s overall position and include its prospects in your assessment. In this case, a stock split will only be an added benefit.</p><h3>Psychological comfort</h3><p>It is easier for shareholders to buy Tesla stock for $200 than for $1,000. But that''s just psychology. As far as finances are concerned, not much changes for the investor.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>We’ve reviewed why companies do stock splits and what benefits a stock split has for an investor. All in all, a stock split doesn’t influence the value of shares but makes stocks more affordable for investors (which is especially relevant for fast-growing companies whose stocks become more and more expensive).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To join the most successful investors, you need to be among the first to receive the most important information.

In addition, we will consider the essence of after-hours trading and some real examples of famous companies.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is After-Hours Trading?</h2><p>After-hours trading is trading in the stock markets after the market closes at 4 p.m. in the United States. This allows trading securities after the market is closed with no further price movement.</p><p>Can you buy stocks after hours? Yes. Investors are allowed to trade stocks, even if the market is closed, i.e., outside of business hours, thus reacting to the latest news and events related to stocks and making profits before the market reopens the next day.</p><h2>How does the After-Hours Trading Process Work?</h2><p>How to trade after hours? Let''s take a look at the process.</p><p>Stock markets in the U.S. open at 9 a.m. and close at 4 p.m. The session lasts from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., during which investors can trade securities without any effect on prices.</p><p>Here are some important facts about trading after hours:</p><ul><li>Among high-net-worth individuals and risky organizations such as mutual funds, after-hours trading is more popular than regular trading.</li><li>After-hours trading is more common among high-risk investors who want to risk their investments for greater returns.</li><li>There are certain rules and regulations that apply to after-hours trading compared to regular trading hours in terms of the type of orders taken and the presence or absence of market makers.</li></ul><p>If you place after-hours orders per share only after the market closes, the stock will trade at the opening price the next day, but only after the market reopens.</p><p>When trading after-hours, the trader must consider that all transactions will not be made through the exchange but directly between the parties. This is known as over-the-counter trading. To do this, you need to find another trading partner willing to enter into a contract with you. Your broker will help you with this.</p><p>Can you sell a stock after hours? Of course, you can make transactions both to buy and to sell assets.</p><p>If you want to exchange warrants after hours, the relevant issuer usually provides you with the appropriate trading rates. All of these rates, of course, are constantly changing depending on supply and demand.</p><p>However, unlike official exchange trading, there is usually less liquidity and fewer securities in after-hours trading. Typically, large price fluctuations are possible. Therefore, it is essential to set a limit. The price at which the exchange trade ended will usually be different from the regular exchange price.</p><h3>Example of trading after hours</h3><p>We''ve already figured out the answers to “What does after-hours trading mean?” and “Can you buy stocks after hours?”. Now let''s look at such a trade using LinkedIn as an example.</p><p>On Thursday, February 4, 2016, the U.S. company LinkedIn announced its annual numbers after hours. Investors received them poorly, and at 22:05, the stock began to fall. Overall, the price loss after the trading day was 30%.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1292px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61a5500e5e590f58a1849351_BhkGrYFl76Vagda42-KTt9bWHD0qWlNioEPp6-W08m4QZukmuduf5C39_TweztpLnCYAhPmVbQEXI7d8xyJvtqH9XExB_KjeTfRM8KbgoAl0NnQqhS6E2yHhAPLH_JdmcigdVyJq.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" alt="linkedin chart fall delisted photo"></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>Most brokers offer their clients the opportunity to participate in pre-and post-market trading, which gives investors the option to trade and manage positions. If you don''t have this option, as is often the case with many other brokers, you can wait and react only at 3:30 p.m. on the next trading day.</p><p>Looking at the trading volume on Thursday, February 4, we can see that on that day, during market hours, just over 5 million shares were sold. However, in the aftermarket hours, the trading volume for the day was almost three times higher(right corner). The reason is after-hours trading, as almost 40 million shares were sold during that time, and the trading volume was twice as much as in normal hours.</p><p>Now let''s look at the after-hours price reaction. The LinkedIn stock was trading slightly below $190 at the end of normal trading hours on Thursday. On Friday, Feb. 5, at 2:30 p.m., an hour before Wall Street opened, the LinkedIn stock was trading more than 30 percent lower than the day before. The price was just over $130. When the stock opened, the discount on the stock was 42%.</p><p>Having the ability to manage your positions outside of normal trading hours can make a big difference in the return on your stock portfolio. You don''t have to think whether you should buy the stock after hours and wait for the next day; when the U.S. stock exchanges open at 3:30 pm, you can start trading at any time. Many brokers allow you to do this.</p><h2>8 Risks and Pitfalls of After-Hours Trading</h2><p>If you’re still wondering, ‘Should I buy stocks after hours?’, keep in mind that many traders use the opportunity to trade before the official opening of the market and after the market closes to quickly react to news events and other factors that arise outside business hours.&nbsp;</p><p>However, such activity is associated with an increased short-term risk.&nbsp;</p><p>In this regard, the SEC warns investors of the following risks:</p><ul><li><strong>Not being able to see or use quotes.</strong> Some brokers display quotes only within their trading system, not showing them to other ECNs.</li><li><strong>Lack of liquidity.</strong> During after-hours sessions, the number of traders is much smaller, so liquidity is significantly reduced.</li><li><strong>Increased spreads. </strong>A decrease in trading activity leads to an increase in spreads, making it difficult to execute orders at acceptable prices.</li><li><strong>Volatility. </strong>Price fluctuations during this time can be greater than during the official session, especially during news releases.</li><li><strong>Price uncertainty. </strong>Stock prices in pre-market and post-market trading may differ from prices during the official trading session.</li><li><strong>The tendency to limit orders. </strong>Many ECNs accept only limit orders and do not accept market orders.</li><li><strong>Competition with professional traders. </strong>The pre-market and post-market are traded mainly by professionals who have access to more data and insights and are generally more experienced.</li><li><strong>Computer delays.</strong> Technical support for the trading process deteriorates after hours, so the trader may encounter delays in executing his orders.</li></ul><p>The price of Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) in February 2019 is an excellent example of how the after-hours trade and what dangers are associated with it. Nvidia released its quarterly results on Feb. 14.</p><p>The stock was met with a sharp jump in price, rising to nearly $169 from $154.50 within 10 minutes of the news.</p><p>Trading volume was steady for the first 10 minutes and then quickly declined after 4:30 pm. About 700,000 shares were sold in the first 5 minutes of trading, and the stock jumped nearly 6 percent. However, trading volume dropped significantly, with only 350,000 shares sold from 4:25 to 4:30. By 5:00 p.m., trading volume had dropped to 100,000 shares, and the stock was still trading at about $165.</p><p>However, everything changed the following day when all market participants got a chance to evaluate Nvidia''s results. Between 9:30 and 9:35 a.m., nearly 2.3 million shares were sold, more than three times the amount sold in the first minutes of afternoon trading the previous day, and the price dropped from $164 to $161.</p><p>The stock continued to trade lower for the rest of the day, closing at $157,20. This was only $3 above the previous day''s closing price after rising nearly $15 in after-hours trading.</p><div></div><h2>After-Hours Trading: Benefits for a Trader</h2><p>Listed below are some benefits of trading after hours:</p><ul><li><strong>Convenience. </strong>After-hours trading is more comfortable for investors who cannot trade during regular market hours.</li><li><strong>Ability to take advantage of fresh data. </strong>Off-peak sessions provide investors with the opportunity to trade new information released after the close of the regular trading day. The information can have a short-term effect that traders can react to quickly before the next trading session.</li><li><strong>Technical analysis.</strong> One day, you can analyze the stock chart and react to it before the market opens at 9:00 a.m. the next day.</li></ul><p>As you can see, there are advantages to trading after hours.</p><p>Some might think that after-hours trading is a bad idea. But if you take a closer look, you’ll see that it can provide you with good earning opportunities.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>In this article, we''ve provided you with important information about what after-hours trading is, why trading during this time is very risky, and how it can turn out for a trader. We hope now you know the answer to the question ''Is it good to buy stocks after hours?</p><p>In addition, we considered the essence of trading after hours and gave real examples.

The stock price earning ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the company''s earnings per share (EPS). If the EPS is not known, it can be calculated by finding out the company''s revenue. This calculation can be done by deducting the company''s paid dividends from its earnings for the year. This value is divided by the total shares outstanding.</p><p>How to interpret P/E ratio meaning is also essential. Questions like what is P/E ratio in stocks? What is a good P/E ratio for a stock? What is a good price to earnings ratio in an industry? These are all relevant questions. Having the answers can help to improve your portfolio management strategy.<br></p><p><strong>The mainstream P/E valuation use is to assess the value of a stock or index.</strong> A low P/E ratio implies that the stock or an index is less expensive compared to its returns. The opposite also applies; a stock P/E ratio can be high, making it more costly than its earnings. Now how to use P/E ratio? Calculating P/E ratio allows investors to categorize investments. This is done by using the current P/E ratio of stocks and indexes and classifying them as growth or value investments. The decision to invest can depend on the individual trader''s preference and trading strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>A stock P/E ratio<strong> </strong>allows investors to<strong> </strong>see if the<strong> </strong>stock price or index is over- or undervalued. The ratio analysis of any stock may yield overpriced stocks or indexes, which is taken as a signal for growth stocks. Undervalued stocks are seen as value investments, meaning stocks that are expected to grow in the future, possibly over a long period of time.</p><h2>Price-to-Earnings Ratio Formula</h2><p>If you want to know how to calculate price earnings ratio, you can use the formula below:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61a7a31e5bd594870e78c79d_P%3AE%20Ratio%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="p/e ratio formula equals stock price div by earnings per share - photo" width="auto" height="auto"></div><figcaption><em>Figure 1: PE Ratio Formula</em></figcaption></figure><p>The formula is fairly straightforward if you use a ratio calculator.

Dell’s Pricing Graphs</em></figcaption></figure><p>From Figure 3 above, you can see that the stock prices do not reflect declining EPS. In fact, in some areas, it seems like stock prices are higher where EPS is low. Similarly, the PE ratio graph is somewhat like the EPS graph. At the same time, the pe stock price chart doesn''t match its dips and highs. This figure shows the inherent problem with the PE ratio.</p><h2>What is a Good P/E Ratio for a Stock?</h2><p>Now that we are aware of how to calculate the P/E ratio, we can try understanding how to interpret it. As we discussed earlier, investors see a share with a high P/E ratio as being more attractive. It also shows that buyers are okay with paying a higher amount for each share. This good price is acceptable because they foresee rapid growth and high profitability, and subsequently higher earnings.</p><p>To decide if a price/earnings ratio is on the higher or lower side, we have to assess it. This is done through comparison with the P/E ratios of peer firms operating in the same niches. For example, if one firm has a P/E of 10x, and a majority of peer companies have P/E ratios of 12x earnings, it is safe to say that the company you have picked is considered less valuable by the market.<br></p><p>On average, the P/E ratio for stocks ranges around the 20-25 mark. This ratio means that investors are willing to pay $20-$25 per $1 of company earnings. However, there are specific industries where that average P/E ratio can be much lower or much higher.<br></p><p>For instance, firms in traditionally high-growth categories like tech, biotech, e-commerce, and other high-growth sectors can have significantly larger P/E ratios than the stock market average. For example, Amazon (AMZN) has maintained a P/E ratio of approximately 60[1]. Compared with the average P/E ratio of the S&amp;P 500 index of 15 makes the earnings from Amazon are much more expensive for investors.<br></p><p>From a portfolio management perspective, income from Amazon shares is much more expensive than other companies. Investors that look for value for their investment would not opt for Amazon shares because of its high P/E ratio.</p><h2>The Drawbacks of Price-to-Earnings Ratio Calculation</h2><p>While the P/E ratio is commonly used and well known for stock analysis by investors for portfolio selection, it has its limitations. From the Amazon example, the P/E of 60 signifies that its earnings are expensive. Suppose we look at just the P/E ratio. But if we look at the IPO offering price of $18 in 1997 and compare it with the current trading price, it suddenly seems to make sense to invest in the stock.</p><p>Since P/E ratios are by definition calculated from company earnings and average price, which can be inflated due to extraordinary income. They can also be deflated due to some one-off expenses, like a damages claim or project costs. These instances can skew the P/E ratio for some firms. Creative and diverse accounting approaches also affect the bottom line of a business’s income statements and may distort the P/E ratio as well.<br></p><p>A significant limitation of the P/E ratio is its reliance on past earnings. While the stock price changes daily, the earnings figures can be as old as three months since most companies report their earnings quarterly. This mismatch causes two problems: the first; the P/E ratio does not report concurrent income. The second is that the historical revenues do not guarantee success for any stock in the future.<br></p><p>This problem is overcome by some investors who feel that the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is a basic formula to gauge a stock''s current value. They modify the formula to adjust it for its bias for historical prices. These investors compare two variations of the formula. One version compares the stock''s price to the income in the past 12 months and the second version compares the cost to the projected earnings for the coming 12 months.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>The P/E ratio links a stock''s market rates with its earnings per issued share (EPS). The stock price earning ratio is obtained by dividing the latest stock rates by the firm’s earnings per share (EPS). If the EPS is not known,&nbsp; it can be calculated by finding out its income. Income is calculated by subtracting the company''s paid dividends from its earnings for the year. This value is divided by the total shares outstanding. Most screeners, including Gainy, have the option of showing the<strong> </strong>P/E ratio when showing details about the stock.&nbsp;<br></p><p>On average, most stocks have a P/E ratio that is fifteen times higher than the earnings per share. This means that most stocks have a P/E ratio of 15x. If the P/E is above this benchmark, the stock is pricey, making it a growth stock. If the ratio is below this, the stock may be a good buy for value investment.</p><h2>FAQ<br></h2>', 'This article discusses the meaning and definition of the P/E ratio of stocks.

A warrant is a security that gives the holder the right to buy a proportionate number of shares at a specific price over a certain period, usually cheaper than the current market price. On this basis, a stock warrant is explained like that: a warrant is a certificate granting the right to purchase securities.</p><p>A warrant is a bonus for a major investor from the issuer. If an investor buys a major stock or bond, the issuer can issue them a warrant (company certificate) as a bonus, entitling the investor to buy additional stock in the company at a fixed price for a certain period. If, during this time:</p><ul><li>the market rises sharply, the warrant will, of course, induce the investor to buy an additional block of stock to make a profit;</li><li>the market price of the stock falls, the investor will certainly not buy common stocks at the value specified in the warrant because it is more profitable for them to buy them on the exchange (or not to buy them at all; examples below).</li></ul><p>Thus, warrants can complement a traditional portfolio, being a risky but high-profitable tool in the long run. If the market rises, warrants can become a way for investors to generate extra income.</p><p>Many large securities-issuing corporations have forced exchange operators to list their warrants on stock exchanges. Warrants can be easily identified by the "w" symbol that appears after the stock ticker of the issuing company.</p><p>Warrants are also traded in the over-the-counter market (i.e., off-exchange) and are sold directly from investor to investor without paying brokerage fees and exchange spreads.</p><p>Thus, classic warrants can be found on both primary and secondary securities markets.</p><p>The broadest and most interesting range of warrants is displayed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, where one can easily buy any of the 884 offered warrants for shares and the DAX 30 Index, offered by the largest financial institutions, such as, for example, the Swiss bank UBS.</p><p>Warrants on shares to sell may be more attractive for medium- or long-term investments. They are high-risk, high-yield investment instruments.</p><p>For example, an investor would need $2,000 to buy 1,000 shares trading at $2. If an investor buys warrants at $1 (with a 1-to-1 conversion ratio), they will buy 2,000 shares for $2,000.</p><p>Warrants are also an attractive option for speculators and hedgers. This is because the value of warrants is usually low, and the initial investment required to manage large amounts of capital is minimal. Stock warrants are a popular instrument provided by pension funds.<br></p><h2>Stock Warrants vs. Stock Options</h2><p>Warrants and options have things in common, but they still differ. The main differences between a warrant and a call option are as follows:</p><ul><li>A warrant is a security that is issued by a company while an option is a fixed-term contract, the result of an option transaction;</li><li>The number of warrants is limited to the number of issues of the security, and the number of options transactions entered into is limited to the needs of the market;</li><li>Warrants are issued for a long term, and stock options are usually short-term;</li><li>When warrants are issued, the amount of the company''s capital (equity or debt) increases when the warrants are exercised, and options transactions have nothing to do with the company''s capital;</li><li>Warrants are issued to their original holders free of charge, payment for the warrant is not provided, and the option holder pays a premium for it to the subscriber (seller) of the option.</li></ul><div></div><h2>4 Tips for Investors Before Buying Stock Warrants</h2><p>Now let’s look at some tips on how to buy stock warrants to help you learn how to add them to your portfolio.</p><h3>Learn how warrants work</h3><p>Before you know how to buy stock warrants, it is essential to understand how exactly warrants work. By accessing a "warrant contract" to buy or borrow a stock, a trader can get a chance to reach potential profit from a rise or fall in the price of a stock at a lower investment cost than if they had simply bought shares of a company directly and waited for them to grow up.</p><h3>Consider all the options</h3><p>In addition to understanding what a warrant stock is, novice traders should pay attention to the most critical aspects of these instruments. One of them is the price at which the sale or triggering of a contract yields a higher profit. Experts define warrants as "in the money" or "out of the money," depending on how much the price must rise to make a profit. Investors should carefully examine how deep a warrant is "in the money" or "out of the money."</p><p>Another factor to pay attention to is the results of the company. The value of their shares will directly depend on it. Yes, warrants will allow you to buy a company''s stock when it reaches a certain price, but the stock may fall so much that its price will never rise.</p><p>Also, pay attention to investor demand. The higher it is, and the more people talk about the company, the higher the likelihood that its share price will grow.</p><h3>Always track the latest information</h3><p>Those who want to trade in fluctuating warrants should have access to a clear list of the value of the various warrants. They should be able to simply call or use an online account to create a warrant and use that warrant when the stock price has changed in their favor. It is best if the online trading account keeps good records. It''s also important to look at the commissions and any other costs of the warrant to see if buying stock warrants is profitable according to the likely projected share price in the short term.</p><h3>Watch your risks and limit them</h3><p>Another good tip for trading fluctuating warrants is to limit your risks.

This article covers that as well as the meaning of DRIP to a portfolio strategy.', 'Dividend Reinvestment: How To Plan Your Money Flow', '<p>This reinvestment program involves reinvesting the dividends received on the date of dividend payment. DRIP programs can be the automatic reinvestment options that most brokerage or investment companies offer, as well as a formal drip stocks plan provided by a company for its stocks and dividends.</p><h2>What is DRIP in Investing?</h2><p>When companies pay dividends,<strong> </strong>they are usually released to shareholders through check or cash deposit into their specified account. Dividend reinvestment plans, known as DRIPs, are a convenient means to reinvest dividends. Dividend reinvestment stocks give shareholders the chance to invest in more shares of a stock they already hold. DRIP stocks allow investors to opt for direct dividend reinvestment of shares that they already own.&nbsp;</p><p>Shares bought through a DRIP investing strategy are purchased from the share issuer and come from the company''s reserves. This means that shares bought this way cannot be traded like standard shares on the stock market.</p><p>Having a DRIP account lets you buy stocks for your portfolio without paying any commission or for a comparatively low fee. These would be priced significantly lower compared to the prevailing market rate. Drip stocks are usually issued with minimum investment and selling requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>Most DRIPs are issued for people who have opted for the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) and already possess regular company shares. However, some companies offer DRIP investment for new investors subject to some minimum investment parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Three Common Types of DRIPs</h2><p>There are three types of DRIPs, depending on who they''re operate by: the company, a third party or a broker.</p><h3>Company-Operated Dividend Reinvestment Plan</h3><p>Some companies that are in the large-capitalization category run their DRIPs. For instance, S&amp;P 500 Index members Abbott Laboratories (ABT), 3M Company (MMM), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) run their dividend reinvestment plans.&nbsp;</p><p>These plans offer investors the benefit of no-fee options, which reduces your investment cost and makes the DRIP reinvestment process straightforward.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Third-party Operated Dividend Reinvestment Plan</h3><p>Many companies that offer options for DRIPs outsource the management of their DRIP program to third-party agents. These agents are known as transfer agents. You need to remember that these agents usually have some fees for opening an investment account and for buying and selling subsequent shares. Most of these agents will have websites and portals for searching and researching DRIP reinvestment stocks.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Broker-Operated Dividend Reinvestment Plan</h3><p>Most brokerage firms also offer guides and options on how to invest in DRIP stocks. Investors just need to pick the invest in DRIP options and start DRIP stock investing. You just choose the stocks for your portfolio, add them to your brokerage''s DRIP. Your brokerage will begin to reinvest dividend payments into new shares in your DRIP portfolio. A DRIP method<strong> </strong>implemented through a brokerage or even a robo-advisor is the best investment strategy for DRIP reinvestment.&nbsp;</p><h2>4 Benefits of a Dividend Reinvestment Plan for an Investor&nbsp;</h2><p>Now that we know what is drip in investing, let''s discuss is dividend reinvestment good in the short-term and the long term?</p><ol><li>Fees free reinvestment</li></ol><p>As margins and portfolio returns shrink, drip investing, meaning low or no fees, is levied on the reinvestment of your capital in shares that are already in your portfolio.

Opting for a DRIP allows investors to enjoy portfolio compounding with little expense. As a company issues dividends, they continue to be reinvested into more shares through the DRIP plan. This reinvestment allows investors to increase their number of shares, which increases their dividends, and then the number of shares rises as dividends get reinvested into more shares. This allows for portfolio returns to be compounded.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61af2fd333501df3b303efa9_YM2OGPEm6tg-3ZI3zi0cGAHQNrLARYJQRYHLHkAy2dqmbjV1o6w8K29978FFf5OIUz60e6nLxbJYhxvR-qF6lPLB5cHFOP3CeMK2agpXcQribdIf44_aYUoyNI7l663mZuOG6p1x.jpeg" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" alt="the power of dividends and compounding photo"></div><figcaption><em>Figure 2.

This matches with the strategy of investing in dividend stocks and with the core of what are DRIPs. The company gains long-term stability with a shareholder locked in due to access to cheaper investment. The company gets market stability and access to a stable set of shareholders.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Start Your Dividend Reinvestment Plan?</h2><p>To start your dividend reinvestment plan you will have to look at different plans and pick the one you prefer. We have already answered the question “what is a dividend reinvestment plan?” and how it can be implemented. To start a drip plan, you need to finalize which form of DRIP will suit you. All three forms have their advantages and disadvantages. However, planning money is easier through a brokerage DRIP account.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Opting for a company''s DRIP plans will mean that you will have to opt for the DRIP plans of all the companies in your portfolio that offer them. Doing this will involve unnecessary work and planning and can be challenging to track, particularly if you have a diverse portfolio of shares.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Opting for a DRIP plan offered by your broker will mean a one-stop option for your entire portfolio, and it will provide ease of use and monitoring. Many brokerages offer DRIP plans for fractional shares as well, unlike company plans. Another advantage of opting for a brokerage is that if a company doesn''t offer a DRIP plan but does pay out dividends, you can set up a DRIP for it with your broker through a brokerage DRIP account.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Every brokerage account follows its system for dividend reinvestment of stocks. You will have to refer to your broker''s help page or customer support for guidance on how to open or set up a DRIP account. However, most have easy-to-use and online account setup procedures for quick activation of investment processes.</p><div></div><p>Suppose you opt for a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for an individual company. In that case, you will need to get in touch with its investor relations department or representative to have your DRIP account set up by the company.&nbsp;</p><h3>Treatment of Taxes&nbsp;</h3><p>You have to keep in mind that regardless of how much or how little you spent on getting a dividend reinvestment plan on stocks, you will still be liable to pay taxes on the income. Paying the tax amount is usually not an issue for most people if you get a few (hundred) dollars extra. However, if your dividend income is higher, your tax payable will also increase, and you will be bound to pay the taxes on the dividend income you reinvested. Paying this usually means a cash outlay from your spending income.&nbsp; This can be a concern for investors who reinvest all their dividend income into DRIP plans and tie up their funds.&nbsp;</p><p>Some tax advisors recommend placing dividend stocks in investment accounts that offer tax benefits as an individual retirement account, commonly known as an IRA.&nbsp;</p><p>IRAs are beneficial for savings as they offer tax advantages. An IRA grants their account owners exemption from paying income tax on any growth of their investments. This means that any amount paid into your IRA is tax-exempt. Don''t get too excited! You will end up paying taxes at various stages. Payments into traditional IRA accounts can cut taxes in the present. However, you will be taxed on all withdrawals when you withdraw funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>For beginner investors trying to expand their portfolios by picking options that allow for portfolio compounding, a DRIP investing strategy<strong> </strong>is a sensible choice to make.&nbsp; DRIP investment offers you subsidized shares, which yield more dividends, and then they pay more shares and dividends. Most DRIP plans also mean that you can benefit from share price increases in the market.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61af30273f617cc9c96d38f5_9bhTfXuFMbGj_OitCGCmfrq5TB8Ciz4ayCMYRS90vkv3_yxRLZ63XAaqaUb2rmD9aXZrvulzO0sBiNlOkt5z3w3_H8Dh7O1V2HUJPF6K_JLQ-BghI47gSAhwdaG2WRJS8ejkxbKR.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" alt="power of dividend growth - photo"></div><figcaption><em>Figure 3.

For investors looking to generate an additional flow of income through dividends, a DRIP plan will not make much sense as it will eat up all extra income from dividends.&nbsp;</p><p>DRIPs, however, are a popular means of expanding your investment into dividend stocks and can be added to a portfolio mix to increase compounding, reduce the cost of capital and allow investors to capitalize on the lower price of shares in DRIP accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>The process of DRIP investment is straightforward and can allow for portfolio growth through easy reinvestment.

Let''s find out more on the topic and discover how shareholders receive dividends and more.', 'What is a Dividend Payout and How Does It Work?', '<h2>What is a Dividend?</h2><p>A dividend is a total amount or amount per share that a stock corporation pays to its shareholders. That''s how dividends are explained.</p><p>Most publicly traded corporations do not distribute all of their profits to their owners or shareholders, but only a portion of them (e.g., a 60% distribution ratio). The amount of the dividend is determined by the general meeting of shareholders.</p><h3>Types of dividends by form of distribution</h3><ul><li><strong>Share dividends</strong>. This term comes from the English word "share.” If a shareholder receives their share of profits in stock dividends, they do not receive any cash. Instead, they receive their profits in the form of additional shares in the company.</li></ul><p>This is a way for companies to save cash for other purposes. If a company is growing rapidly and expects high profits, a high dividend on the shares may be advantageous. This form of profit distribution is also known as "bonus stock" or "bonus shares" if the shares paid out are owned by the same company. If additional shares are issued as dividends, this is also known as a "stock split.”</p><ul><li><strong>Cash dividends.</strong> This is a direct distribution of profits to the account of the respective shareholder. The amount of profit each shareholder will receive per share is determined in advance.</li><li><strong>Dividends in kind</strong>. In this case, shareholders receive a distribution in the form of tangible assets. The range here is vast. "Tangible assets" can be, for example, shares in subsidiaries as well as tangible goods such as cars or products produced by the company.</li></ul><h3>Types of dividends by frequency of payment</h3><p>In terms of frequency of payment, shareholder dividends are divided into three types:</p><ul><li>annual type;</li><li>semi-annual;</li><li>quarterly.</li></ul><p>Because of this classification, many shareholders who missed the deadline for closing the registers but know how often dividends are paid do not worry too much because many organizations issue dividends throughout the reporting year. Nevertheless, you should always keep a close eye on the articles of association and control the timing of payments.</p><h3>Types of dividends by size</h3><p>In terms of size, dividends can be classified as:</p><ul><li>full one-time payment;</li><li>partial payments.</li></ul><p>In the first case, the entire amount is paid to the recipient; in the second case, the payment is made in installments. The amount paid in full is a lump sum, while partial payments are usually made in several stages during the accounting year. Understanding this will help you understand how dividend payments work.</p><h3>Types of dividends by type of stock</h3><p>Dividends are also classified by stock type.</p><ul><li>Dividends on preferred stock are worth a lot more; this is stated in the organization''s charter.</li><li>Common stock is valued by directors at separate meetings. Preferred stock owners have several advantages because they own a percentage of the profits of the entire organization.</li></ul><h3>Types of dividends according to the method of settlement</h3><p>There are monetary types of settlement and dividends in the form of the ownership of the organization. As for the property, dividends are paid in the form of company shares. This phenomenon is widespread in foreign companies.</p><h2>How are Dividends Paid to Shareholders?</h2><p>Do you want to know when stocks pay dividends? The order of payment of dividends can be quite different — they can be paid annually or once — it all depends on the particular case. Payments affect capitalization or, to be exact, reduce it. If dividends are paid before the end of the reporting year, they are called interim dividends. Dividends paid at the end of the year are called final dividends.</p><p>Dividends are usually paid in cash, but they can also be paid in stock or property. Therefore, dividends come in either cash or stock dividends.</p><p>How do dividends work? Let’s review a case study.</p><h3>Dividend distribution example</h3><p>The share capital of Meier AG is €1 million and is divided into shares with a par value of €1 each (hence, there are 1 million shares).</p><p>In the fiscal year 2018, Meier AG made a profit (net profit after taxes) of €2,000,000.</p><p>As in previous years, 60% of this amount (payout ratio) will be distributed to shareholders as dividends.</p><p>This is proposed at the annual general meeting (AGM), and if it accepts the proposal, the dividend is usually paid the day after the AGM.</p><p>If, for example, the board of directors and supervisory board have already made a partial distribution of profits, the distribution will not be made from the annual surplus but from retained earnings.</p><h3>Calculation and dividend check</h3><p>The total amount of the distribution will be €1,200,000 (60% of €2 million).</p><p>A dividend of €1.20 (€1,200,000/1,000,000 shares) is paid on each of the 1 million shares. Thus, a shareholder owning 50 shares in Meier AG receives a gross dividend (usually tax-free) of €60.</p><p>A private shareholder (or GmbH owner) must pay 25% income/capital gains tax (€15) plus a solidarity fee (5.5% of €15 = €0.825) on top of the gross dividend. Thus, the net dividend reaches €44,175.</p><p>What happens to the remaining 40% of retained earnings?</p><p>The remaining €800,000 will be retained (retained earnings through transfer to income reserves) and will be used to finance the company itself (e.g., it can be invested in new machines or generally in the further growth of the company).</p><h2>When Does a Company Pay Dividends?</h2><p>When do dividends get paid? It depends on the policy of the issuer. Typically, security holders receive income from 1 to 4 times during 12 months. Many U.S. companies, such as Apple, prefer to set the stock dividends payment date every 3 months.</p><h3>Timing of distributions on common and preferred shares</h3><p>The frequency of distribution of income to investors depends on the type of security. Dividends on preferred securities are usually paid at the end of the reporting year, while dividends on common securities are paid quarterly or every 6 months.</p><p>How many days after the cutoff are dividends paid?</p><p>If the shares are the investor''s own funds, the dividend will arrive in a brokerage or bank account within 25 days after the cutoff. Dividends on preferred stock are usually paid first.</p><p>If the stock is purchased with borrowed funds (on margin), the timing may be different from usual.</p><p><strong>Warning</strong>. The payment of profits to depositors results in a dividend gap. Investors at this point are not interested in buying shares of the issuer at a high price, so the quotes fall sharply. But the value of securities of reliable companies usually quickly returns to previous values.</p><h2>What to Do with Dividends Next</h2><p>Now you know how often stocks pay dividends. But what to do next? After dividends are paid, each shareholder decides for themselves how to manage them. They can be spent for any purpose, but it is more effective to reinvest the money to maximize profits.</p><p>Some investors are seriously concerned about whether it makes sense to reinvest dividend payments or whether it is better to spend income on their own needs.</p><p>It turns out that regular dividend investments in stocks result in higher returns by the end of the investment term. The difference is especially noticeable over a long time horizon.</p><p>According to analysts'' calculations, the yield on securities, taking into account reinvestment, can be more than 1.5 times higher than the yield on the same assets when dividends are simply accumulated.</p><p>Such a result is explained by the fact that after each dividend payment and reinvestment of income, the number of shares in the investor''s portfolio increases. The next time an even larger amount of dividends is received and reinvested from the increased number of shares. As a result of reinvesting, the yield grows like a snowball, and you become not only the owner of more and more shares but also the recipient of more and more dividend income.</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Dividend reinvestment should be doubled if the company''s stock price starts to decline.

The Little Book of Valuation: How to Value a Company, Pick a Stock, and Profit by Aswath Damodaran</h3><p>Valuation, or determining the intrinsic value of a company, is probably the most important activity in stock analysis. This is because without knowing the intrinsic value, it is difficult for us to assess whether a stock is cheap in the market or not.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with valuation techniques, etc., <em>The Little Book of Valuation</em> is the perfect place to start. It will surely become one of your favorite books about investing.&nbsp;</p><p>From Damodaran''s Little Book of Evaluation, we learn the following:</p><ul><li>The common approaches to valuation (both internal and relative valuation)</li><li>Why our valuations are usually not independent and influenced by information we already know about a company. The book tells us why this usually leads to wrong decisions and how to deal with this.</li><li>Why a simple approach is usually better</li><li>How to determine intrinsic value step by step using the DCF (FCFF-based) method.</li></ul><p><em>The Little Book of Valuation</em> is great for beginners who want to learn a little more about business valuation and for whom it was always too abstract. Some economic knowledge won''t hurt here, but it''s not required either.</p><p>And as the title itself says, it''s really a small and very understandable book that you can read quickly in a few days...not one of those thick academic books that have a lot of theory but little practical relevance. It is one of those great investment books that are definitely worth a read.</p><p>So, what is the main content, and why do we recommend this book to anyone analyzing companies as a DIY value-oriented investor?</p><p>First, the basics of valuation. Damodaran begins by describing the different basic approaches to valuation (internal and relative). Then, he dispels several myths that surround the whole valuation topic. For example, the myth that the evaluation process always has to be detailed and complicated. In many cases, it is even better to ignore unnecessary details. Since business valuation results are always wrong anyway, additional detail in many cases only increases the likelihood of prediction error (valuation error).</p><p>Second, it is the understanding of time value. Damodaran visually explains the concept of intrinsic value, starting with the simplest case of dividend payments, which we receive over a long period. In the next step, he explains the concept of the time value of these payments (the money we receive today is more valuable than the money we will receive in the future).</p><div></div><h2>Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2><p>We have considered the best books to learn about investing and financial literacy, but hardly all the best books on stock investing worthy of your attention can fit into one review.

EPS (Earning Per Share) is one of the essential indicators that help investors assess their risks and potential profits.</p><p>So, what is a good earnings per share ratio?</p><p>EPS ratio is a financial indicator that results from the ratio of a company''s net profit to the number of common shares outstanding during an annual period.</p><p>The essence of the EPS ratio, to put it simply, is that each shareholder who owns shares in a company has a stake in its share capital. Equity capital is equal to the number of issued shares of the company. That is, each shareholder has their share of the company''s profits. Profit received by the company is distributed in proportion to the share of each shareholder. Accordingly, this ratio determines how great the return on each dollar invested in the company''s stock, relative to the profits received (price to earnings). The higher the EPS, the higher the yield of money invested in the shares of the business.</p><p>By paying attention to the EPS rating, an investor can estimate the growth rate of profits from owning the stock. Based on the data of this rating, an investor can find solid stocks.</p><p>The EPS ratio is one of the main calculation elements used in accounting and financial statements. It is used in the international calculation standards of IFRS and US-GAAP. That is why it is essential to know what a good EPS for a stock is.</p><h2>What is a Good EPS?</h2><p>What is a good earnings per share number? Whether it will be good or not depends on a company''s recent results, a company’s value, the competitors’ results, and the expectations of analysts who follow the stock. The company can report on high earnings per share, but its stock could fall in price if analysts expected a better performance. Similarly, a decline in EPS can lead to an increase in price if analysts expected even worse results. It is important to always measure EPS relative to a company''s stock price, for example, based on price-to-earnings (P/E) or profitability ratios.</p><p>You get the idea, what is a good earning per share? Let''s reinforce this knowledge with a case study.</p><p><strong>Let''s calculate the EPS for Apple stock.</strong></p><p>To calculate this number, we need to look at Apple''s annual report and find information about net income. Apple''s net income in the 2021 fiscal year was 94.68 billion.</p><p><em>Don''t worry, that’s just an example! You won’t need to make any calculations manually, because </em><a href="https://www.gainy.app/"><em>gainy.app</em></a><em> does it for you! Download the app and get immediate access to the most up-to-date data on your potential investments.</em></p><p>The number of shares outstanding — 16.86 billion</p><p>Thus, we get the following calculations:</p><p>EPS AAPL = 94.68 / 16.86 = 5.61</p><p>The value of EPS shows what fluctuations in the company''s profitability can be expected in the short term. If EPS is calculated only with the shares outstanding at the moment, it is usually called basic EPS. To calculate the possible impact of diluted capital, it is necessary to calculate diluted EPS.</p><p>To evaluate the rationality of investing in a company’s stock, you will need to make ratio calculations, compare companies and estimate the earnings you can get. And now, we give you 7 tips for determining a good earnings per share ratio.</p><h2>7 Tips to Determine a Good Earnings Per Share Ratio</h2><h3>1. Look at the company''s income statement</h3><p>Before you invest in a company, it''s crucial to understand how it manages its expenses. Evaluate metrics such as operating expenses, gross margin, and net margin. After all, if a company can''t control its expenses accordingly, its financial results will not be satisfactory. This will affect the company''s net income, and therefore the dividends paid to you.</p><h3>2. Analyze the company''s financial situation</h3><p>All publicly-traded companies must report to their shareholders. You can find out what''s going on with the company by looking at EPS reports and its financial statements. Companies publish these on their websites every quarter and then provide a final annual report.</p><p>When you open the report, you will probably be amazed at the number of obscure lines you will see. <strong>The most important ones to look at are revenue, net income, EBITDA, and equity.</strong> A thriving company should be making profits, and its revenue, EBITDA, and equity should be growing. Even without a detailed comparison of ratios, you will get valuable information for your decision.</p><h3>3. Learn all about dividends</h3><p>Find out how the company has previously paid dividends to its shareholders, whether there have been any problems with the payments or serious delays. Find out how EPS has changed over time. A positive trend in this indicator increases the likelihood that the company will continue to pay good dividends to its shareholders.</p><h3>4. Determine liquidity</h3><p>Liquidity indicates how quickly you can buy or sell a company''s stock at market price. It can be high, medium, or low, and the higher the better. If liquidity is low, you don''t even need to do an EPS comparison to figure it out, you may get into a situation where you want to sell or buy the stock but can''t do it at a reasonable price, which will cost you more.</p><h3>5. Do a cash flow statement analysis</h3><p>The cash flow statement allows investors to analyze the quality of the company''s earnings and the operating cash flow in particular. You will be able to compare operating cash flow per share to EPS. Many investors note that operating cash flow per share should be higher than EPS.</p><p>An important point: If EPS is skyrocketing without a similar increase in operating cash flow, or if that cash flow is negative, that is not a good sign. More often than not, this means that the company is incurring very high operating expenses, possibly due to unrealized accounts receivable.</p><h3>6. Compare the EPS of your chosen firm to its competitors</h3><p>The best way to determine how good a company''s EPS is is to compare that figure to its competitors from the same industry.&nbsp;</p><h3>7. Consider Using Multiples</h3><p>Another thing to consider is the use of multiples.</p><p>With multiples, investors often look for undervalued companies whose stock is much cheaper than it should be. This usually happens when the company''s performance is good, but no one has noticed it yet. The problem is identifying companies that are definitely undervalued is not easy.</p><p>Shares of undervalued companies can be bought with the expectation that their share price will rise in the future. Other investors on the market will also realize how promising the company is and start buying its securities, which will increase their value. The main multiples are P/E, DEBT/EBITDA, ROE, EV/EBITDA, P/BV, P/S.</p><p><em>EPS is not a good measure of performance because it does not consider the opportunity cost of capital and can be manipulated by short-term actions. Even when calculating this figure, an investor runs the risk of buying overvalued shares, which will fall sharply in value. Checking the P/E ratio can protect from this risk. A high P/E ratio could mean that a stock''s price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued.</em></p><p>P/E shows how much importance the market attaches to a certain company''s profits. First, the P/E ratio tells us how much an investor is willing to give for each dollar of a company''s earnings data. Secondly, the investor learns their waiting time to recoup their investment through stock returns<em>. </em>Basically, the P/E ratio tells us how confident investors are about the future of the company they are investing in.</p><p>Below we will look at this indicator in more detail.</p><p>Want to be the first to calculate all ratios and be the first to know the most important news? Download the Gainy app now!</p><p>‍</p><div></div><h2>What Should an Investor Know About P/E ratio?</h2><p>The P/E ratio shows how many years it will take a company to reach its market value at its current stock price and earnings, as well as good earnings per share for a stock. However, as simple as calculating the P/E ratio is, its role in valuing a stock is complex. Essentially, the P/E ratio helps determine whether a stock''s price is low or high. However, the ratio by itself is not meaningful. When looking at the P/E ratio, it is especially important to compare it to companies in the same industry. You should also always check to see how the company has evolved over the past five to ten years.</p><h3>High P/E Ratio</h3><p>A high P/E ratio can mean that a company''s stock is in high demand and therefore its price is high too. This could be a sign of overvaluation and possibly an indicator of future price declines.</p><p>Another possibility, however, is that a high P/E ratio indicates strong sales or earnings growth. Investors may be willing to pay a premium for a fast-growing company.</p><h3>Low Price/Earnings Ratio</h3><p>A low P/E ratio means that the stock has a low market valuation compared to the company''s earnings. If the company belongs to an industry that is growing very slowly, a low P/E ratio would not be a disadvantage and possibly a reason for buying the stock.</p><p>However, if the P/E ratio is low because of gloomy earnings projections, buying the stock is probably not advisable, even though it is currently valued cheaply.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Now you know what a high EPS is and what a good EPS ratio is. EPS, in simple terms, is the ratio of net income to the number of shares, which gives us an understanding of how much can be earned per share. It is used solely for comparative purposes between two or more companies, not as a fixed value.</p><p>There are several varieties of EPS, depending on the additional elements in the calculation. For example, diluted, basic, expected EPS. Each of these can be used under different circumstances in a particular strategy.</p><p>From all the above, it follows that stock returns can be one of the most important calculations in evaluating a company''s economic health. However, it should be remembered that there is no single good EPS value, above which it is advisable to buy a firm''s stock and below which it is advisable to sell.</p><p>To make an informed decision, you should spend time comparing the EPS of several competing firms. This approach will help you determine the performance of one firm relative to another similar firm or relative to the industry as a whole.<br></p><h2>FAQ</h2>', 'Investing in stocks is a great way to create a source of income, but an investor should not forget about possible risks.

There is a quote commonly attributed to Albert Einstein:<br></p><blockquote><em>''Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn''t, pays it.'' </em><br></blockquote><p>We’re not sure whether the great man actually said it, but the principle really is that powerful.<br></p><p>You may be familiar with the concept of compound interest. Say you have $100 in a savings account with an interest rate of 10%. This rate of return is science fiction for the US, which brings us all here. But let’s say the Galaxy Far-Far Away Bank still offers an interest rate of 10% on savings. One year later, you have $110 in your account. <br></p><p>Now you have two options. You can either buy two transgalactic cappuccinos with cream and marshmallows from Buckstars, a large coffee chain in the Galaxy, or you can keep it in your account. If you keep it in your account, next year you get 10% on $110, the new amount, and the following year you will have 121. This will make you a millionaire in just 99 years and a billionaire after 174 short years. Not bad.<br></p><p>But succumb to the dark side, and you get nothing. A 100 years later you’ll still be getting 10 bucks on your $100, even if the interest rate is the same. And if you take inflation into account, your savings will be worth nothing.<br></p><p>This is the power of compounding. This is also why learning to invest is so important in the age of vice, misery, and low interest rates. <br></p><p>This also makes it important to plan to invest for the long term, rather than obsessing over Bitcoin doubling in the next 23 minutes.<br></p><p>So what is compound annual growth rate? Read on to find out.</p><h2>What is CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)? <br></h2><p><strong>CAGR stands for compound annual growth rate.</strong> It’s the rate at which an investment grows over a specific time period, taking the compounding factor into account, i.e. provided you don’t take out your profits at the end of each year.<br></p><p><strong>CAGR definition</strong>: the rate at which an investment (or any amount) grows over a period of time, keeping in mind the compounding factor.<br></p><p>This is one of the most popular concepts in finance and investment. It’s a ratio that tells you how your existing or potential investment has been performing over time. However, it can apply to any figure that grows over time leading to more growth. For example, crops or altcoins with silly names.<br></p><p>Say an investment brings you 10% in the first year, 20% in the second year, then 30% in year 3. To work out how much this brings you on average you could add these percentages, divide them by the number of years and that would give you the average rate of return (spoiler: it doesn’t work).<br></p><p>In this case the average rate of return is (10%+20%+30%) / 3 = 20% on average.<br></p><p>But this only tells you the average percentage, without taking into consideration the original sum and what you will actually end up with at the end. Furthermore, if in one year the percentage is negative that can mess up the maths big time.<br></p><p>Say a $100 stock grows by 200% in one year — that’s $300. Then it loses 50% in year 2. 50% of $300 is $150.<br></p><p>So you can’t just add 200% and 50%, divide them by 2, and expect to know how much money you will have in two years. Because, as price changes over time, the percentage relates to growth on the new amount, not the initial one.<br></p><p>This is where a CAGR calculation becomes so helpful. A stock doesn’t produce a constant rate of growth every year, so CAGR gives you a single annual growth rate, a ‘smoothed’ ratio that adds up all the percentages over a period of time, say 5 years. <br></p><p>In fact, it doesn’t even consider the individual percentages throughout the period. It works out the average growth rate using only the beginning and the end value, but this can tell you a lot about the existing or potential growth of an investment. </p><h2>Compound Annual Growth Rate Formula</h2><p>Here’s the CAGR formula in all its compound glory. In case you’re not a math person, don’t be scared, we’re in this together.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61a61a976b929e5af1aefa30_Cagr%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Formula for compound annual growth ratio - photo" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>To work out the compound annual growth ratio<strong>,</strong> we need to: </p><ul><li>Divide the ending value (EV) by the beginning value (BV)</li><li>Raise the result to the power of 1 divided by the number of years, </li><li>Subtract 1 from the result</li></ul><p>Let’s break that down.</p><p>The beginning value (BV) is the sum you have at the beginning of the period; </p><p>The ending value (EV) is the sum you have at the end.</p><p>N is the number of years. So to work out the CAGR over a period of 5 years, you’ll divide the end value by the beginning value, raise the result to the power of ⅕ and subtract 1.</p><p>Raising to the power of x means to multiply a number by itself x number of times. That’s a bit like the result squared, except instead of the exponent “2” you’ll be using 1/n. </p><p>And don’t worry, you don’t have to do all of this in your brain because we’ll be using modern technology.</p><h2>How to Calculate Compound Annual Growth Rate &nbsp;</h2><p>Let’s look at how to use the formula in real life and do a compound growth rate calculation.</p><p>We’ll work out the CAGR for 1 Google share using Google Sheets over a period of 4 years, from 2017 to 2021.</p><p>Let’s say you bought 1 Google share on 9/1/17 for $959.11. After 4 years the price went up to $2916.84. </p><p>Here’s how to calculate CAGR. Let’s put these values into Sheets using the formula: = (EV / BV) ^ (1 / n) – 1. </p><p>Then turn the result into a percentage by pressing <em>Format &gt; Number &gt; Percent</em>.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61a61acc028a79b6ad7d8e31_CAGR%202.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>The CAGR for 1 Google share for this time period is 32.06%. This is the rate that the price of the Google stock has been growing at on average in the last 4 years.</p><p>For comparison, the total percentage growth of Google stock for the same period is 304%. But dividing this number by 4 doesn’t reflect the average return. This is why all these massive growth percentages you see online are more for marketing than for letting you know how much money you can make if you invest in a particular stock.</p><p>What can we say, Google stock looks like a pretty good investment.</p><h2>Why is CAGR Important for Investors?</h2><p>CAGR allows investors to quickly assess the potential of an investment to grow and fixes the limitations of the average return ratio.</p><p>Here are some ways CAGR can be used.<br></p><h3><strong>Goal-setting</strong><br></h3><p>Investors need specific goals in order to get the results they want. Say you have $10,000 to invest and you want to buy a house for $1 million in 10 years, what kinds of investments are most likely to help you achieve that goal? We can use CAGR to work that out.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61a61b009bf842066070432d_Cagr%203.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Example use of CAGR for goal-setting - photo" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h3>Comparing potential investments</h3><p>Investors can use compounded annual growth rate to quickly evaluate the performance of different stocks or different types of investments. For example, it can be used to compare stocks and bonds or stocks and ETFs. </p><p>It’s a good idea to do so against an industry median, i.e. the overall performance of an industry, such as healthcare, technology, and so on. The typical CAGR may be different in different industries.</p><p>Make sure to use the same time periods, because the overall movement of the financial markets can affect the prices of all the assets at once, which can distort your results.<br></p><h3>Analyzing your portfolio</h3><p>You can use CAGR to analyze how the different assets you hold compare in terms of their performance. CAGR analysis can simplify the complex figures you may see, especially if an asset is more volatile, i.e. its price fluctuates considerably.<br></p><h3>Knowing what returns you can expect</h3><p>CAGR can help you see past the hype around growth figures and manipulated percentages and get a realistic view of what you can expect to get over time from a particular type of investment, taking into account the compounding effect.</p><div></div><h2>Limitations of CAGR<br></h2><h3>Does not predict the future</h3><p>Despite being one of the best tools to estimate future growth, CAGR is not in itself a forecast of future performance. It’s important to learn as much as you can about a company<br></p><h3>Does not take volatility into account<br></h3><p>Since CAGR provides a smoothed rate of return on investments over a period of time, it only gives you a ratio based on the beginning and end values. It doesn’t take into account what happens in between and whether an asset is volatile or risky. The markets can have a tremendous effect on the way individual investments are performing, especially when comparing different types of assets. One market may be booming, while another may be in decline, and this may affect the CAGR even more than the performance of different companies. This is something to keep in mind when analyzing different investment options.<br></p><p>Not taking volatility into account can actually be a good thing for long-term investments, because it helps to get rid of all the unnecessary data and focus on what’s happening to an investment over time.<br></p><h3><strong>Does not reflect uneven growth</strong><br></h3><p>A stock price can grow 60% in one year and 10% in other years. CAGR doesn’t take that into account, that’s why it’s helpful to look at the graph to see what’s going on. <br></p><p>If you see that the company’s growth has slowed down, maybe it’s a sign of fundamental problems, like a decrease in demand for a commodity or a service. Then, despite the good CAGR in 5 years, this company may not be worth investing in.<br></p><h3><strong>You need other tools</strong></h3><p>CAGR should not be the only tool you use. Speaking of stocks, in order to identify a good investment, you’ll need to look at a company’s revenue, the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), earnings per share (EPS) and others. It’s also good to know a bit about the company’s culture, their competition, what’s happening in the industry and the whole stock market.<br></p><h3><strong>Can be manipulated</strong></h3><p>Just like any financial data can be misrepresented by measuring growth from a dip to a peak, CAGR can be manipulated in the same way. If an investment has an overly impressive CAGR, e.g. 50% over 5 years, this may be due to the fact it is being measured from the time the company started or due to a recent quick rise in price despite lower previous performance.</p><h2>Revenue growth CAGR and other metrics</h2><p>CAGR is just a growth ratio and can be applied to any number that grows over time. One very important metric is Revenue Growth CAGR, which is a standardized form of measuring a company’s revenue, i.e. how well a company is performing. </p><p>In fact, this is much more important than the stock price. A company’s revenue reflects that a company is doing something right and the market is responding favorably. The stock price is more of a reflection of past performance combined with marketing, whereas revenue shows actual performance and is a good indication of what the stock price is likely to be in the future.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Compound Annual Revenue Growth or CAGR is a very useful formula for working out how well an investment has performed over time. Because it takes into account the compounding effect of reinvesting profits after each year, it gives good insight into how much an investor can expect to profit from a particular asset and what your overall investment returns are possible.</p><p>It’s also great for comparing assets of different classes, such as stocks, ETFs and bonds, or across different industries. In the case of comparing assets in different industries, it’s useful to know the average industry CAGR to have a point of reference.</p><p>The formula can be used for analyzing your portfolio to have the right balance of risk and return that you’re comfortable with psychologically and that will suit your goals. You can also use a CAGR calculator to make it easier.</p><p>There are many more factors and metrics to consider before making an investment decision, and we at Gainy handpicked the most important ones and arranged them in an intuitive way so that even beginners can start finding investments that are right for them.</p><h2>FAQ<br></h2>', 'CAGR is the rate at which an investment grows over a specific time period, taking the compounding factor into account, i.e. provided you don’t take out your profits at the end of each year.', 'Person_6042277873d29f6a6781fd3d', '2022-02-15T08:34:58.091Z', '4.8', '37', '[]', 'what-is-cagr-compound-annual-growth-rate-definition-formula-calculation', 'Download Gainy to match with your perfect investments', 'What is CAGR and How to Calculate Compound Annual Growth Rate? | Gainy', 'Person_6042277873d29f6a6781fd3d', '2022-02-15T08:34:58.091Z'),

', 'Things You Should Know About Stock Market Index to Become a Professional Investor', '<p>Becoming an investor is a long way and there are many schools and methods of predicting and evaluating the market. Stock Market Indexes are essential on your way. However there are thousands of indexes from major stock market indexes as Dow Jones to Samurai Bond Market, and you always have a wide range of choices of which one you want to look at.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is a Stock Market Index?</h2><p>To put it simply, there is a wide range of companies in industries of all kinds. Each index collects data on performance from these companies in order to build a whole picture that would help investors to evaluate and compare ongoing prices with previous prices to calculate the performance of the market. Later in the article we will talk a little bit more about different stock indexes, but for example, if you’re interested in technology you should definitely check the Nasdaq index that evaluates this particular field.&nbsp;</p><h2>Types of Stock Market Indexes</h2><p>What are the different stock indexes? There are different ways to classify different indexes: by weight, by coverage, by ethical investing factors. For example, coverage indexes are extremely useful when we talk about a certain country or region, for example, one of the most famous indexes in the world is S&amp;P 500 that tracks the performance of 500 largest companies in the US.</p><p>What are the major stock indexes? Four of most popular ones:<br></p><h3>Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)</h3><p>Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted measurement index of 30 most notable companies such as Coca-Cola, Disney, Walmart, McDonalds and Boeing. Since 1896 the list of companies has changed 55 times. </p><p>Interesting Fact: General Electric was present in the list from 1896 up to 2018, when it was outrun by pharmaceutical and IT companies.&nbsp;</p><p>We hear about the Dow Jones index on a regular basis on the news and it is considered one of the main tools for investors. However, there is some criticism that comes from the fact that companies in the list are assigned based on their stock price, which is called a price-weighted measurement model. Other stock market indexes are weighted using the market capitalization model.&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61bc335ba4535270df2818ee_GfP0KEZtGtF7XSxI6qKJ9Vx_7yBhVOPShMrwXrqKL8w8MACbSeGXnoCu2MIugFMdIQV-hjw0MS6F7atBx_RRj_xThqtdpF1iZSuObBmB9r9VsrTmrISWlnxbi4swBxVVIC9OZq17.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" alt="DJI vs Nasdaq photo"></div></figure><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:1600px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61bc482d4e23cca912e07fc7_SNbgxDGgRGGUYUDuZ2SWCdWlB--NI7yMuXPt77okbWwoJVZ8wkyH8FIDjcCDCTR_TYa9Je9WrA2RYPNuY5HbJWxOtKVcwecxcZ5TEIMbdU1JTYfFOAFMyzB34P03xENoYWiCVwsN.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" alt="dow and nasdaq comparison photo"></div></figure><h3>NASDAQ (IXIC)</h3><p>The Nasdaq Index is the second popular index of stocks, which includes not only ordinary shares but also real estate trusts and American depositary receipts. The difference between Nasdaq and Dow Jones is that Nasdaq is market-capitalization weighted and includes not only 30 but more than 2500 stocks. The composition of the index is also more diverse: mostly tech companies but also services and finances. All stock market indexes are valuable for investors not just because they give an idea of today''s market but also help to understand the main trends: which industries are becoming leaders and are the most profitable in certain regions or countries.&nbsp;</p><h3>S&amp;P 500 (INX)</h3><p>The S&amp;P 500 also has its roots in the American history of the 19th century, just like the Dow, when the “Investors’ Guide to Railroad History” was published by Henry Poor in 1860. In the beginning of the 20th century it transformed into Standard Statistics Company that rated mortgage bonds and developed a stock market index that included 233 U.S companies. So the idea to evaluate not only one company but a certain field is not that new. Today the stock market index includes 500 large companies from the large-cap sector. This index is perceived as very representative because it includes companies from all sectors of the economy.&nbsp;</p><div></div><ul><li>S&amp;P 500 Growth Index is one more index worth mentioning. It represents the fast-growing companies from the S&amp;P 500. It’s not hard to guess which industry would be largely represented in this index — IT and AI sectors now significantly outweigh other industries.&nbsp;</li><li>S&amp;P MidCap 400 is also distinct from the S&amp;P 500&nbsp; index, worth watching for every investor who is thinking about investing in middle size companies. This index measures the performance of 400 companies to evaluate the return characteristics of this field.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Russell 200 (RUT)</h3><p>Russell 2000 is an index for investors who believe that the future is small-cap companies. If you’re one of them, this is definitely the index for you to watch. Again, the focus lies on the U.S market and mostly it’s used as a benchmark for small-cap stocks. This stock market index may bring the understanding of the particular field of the market and if you’re not an experienced investor, it is important to remember that all the indexes are valuable but you shouldn’t forget about other factors that influence the performance of companies on the market, such as the economic cycle and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also some indexes that are not that obvious but may come in handy if you’re interested in some specific markets.&nbsp;Let’s start from the hottest topic.&nbsp;</p><p>The S&amp;P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index tracks the performance of the digital assets that meet the criteria of minimum liquidity. Cryptocurrency opened a whole new universe in the investment world and it was supposed to be somehow measured in traditional ways, which is what this index does.</p><p>One more important thing is the indexes are grouped not only by industry or market capitalization. There are indexes based on social factors, sector or value.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, JUST U.S Large Cap Diversified Index (JULCD) is an important index that tracks the performance of the companies that have high ESG scores. Over half of them are included in the Russel 2000 index. This score is high in the companies that are known for their employee benefits, outstanding atmosphere and strong commitment to keep the company culture on a high level. So, if you want to support reliable employers and work ethics this is a good index to watch.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to Read Stock Market Indexes?&nbsp;</h2><p>One of the main questions from beginners is “what is a stock market index''s importance for me as an individual investor?”</p><ol><li>To understand the condition of the market: the one that is described in the index, certain industry or country. However, it’s important to remember that indexes do not represent the whole market but only a part of it.</li><li>Indexes are good in terms of learning the historical background of an industry and to watch how it behaved during different parts of the economic cycle and times such as financial crises. This is not a representative forecasting tool.&nbsp;</li><li>There are not that many investors that need to watch these indexes closely on an everyday basis unless it’s your full-time job. Indexes show the main trends and patterns, not something that can influence you every day.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>There is a comparison to explain stock market index. Indexes are the universal language among business people from all over the world. People use it to compare, benchmark and evaluate over time.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>For beginners and conservative investors stock index ETFs are a good start and decent long-term investment idea. For the general audience following main indexes is useful for being informed about the current market situation. Also, comparing your portfolio growth with an index helps assessing the performance and improving your strategy.

The company pays dividends 4 times a year and the annual dividend rate is 2.42%.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168c0bbc20ee31a265939d6_06%20Img%20-%201.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>‍</p><h2>Bonds</h2><p><strong>What?<br></strong>You act as a bank. You give a company or government money for some time to finance their activities. <br></p><p><strong>Where does the money come from?<br></strong>If you act like a bank, then you should get interest. So the bond issuer pays you fixed income every year until the end of the period. At the end of the period they return you the face value of the bond.<br></p><p><strong>Example for kids<br></strong>1. Your friend needs a lot of empty jars for his installation. He borrows an empty jar from you and from a couple of other classmates.<br>Every day of the week your friend gives you one candy for your kindness. At the end of the week you receive your jar.&nbsp;<br>You got back your jar and got 7 candies. <br></p><p><strong>Example for adults<br></strong>A JPMorgan bond. You lend them money by buying their bond at $95. They offer you a 2% yield. The maturity date is 31 July 2033. It means that until 2033 they will pay you a 2% coupon every year and in the end return the price at offering—$100. <br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168c13102c6e13a79249d40_06%20Img%20-%202.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><h2>ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)</h2><p><strong>What?<br></strong>A portfolio of compiled securities. It can consist of just stocks or just bonds, or a mix of the two.&nbsp;<br>You buy a share of this portfolio and it costs cheaper than if you buy all the securities individually.<br></p><p><strong>Where does the money come from?<br></strong>If the price of securities within the fund rises, the price of your share rises.</p><p><strong>Example for kids<br></strong>1. There is a jar with very delicious candies. And the longer it is closed, the more children want it. It has 20 candies, your friend sells a full jar for $10 (the current price of each candy is 50c). You can’t afford to buy the whole jar and your friend doesn’t sell by piece. So you agree that you buy 1/20 of the jar for 50c, meaning that if your friend sells the jar you will receive 1/20.<br>After one week your friend goes to school and sells the jar for $20 to a rich boy. Now you get 1/20 of this—$1.</p><p><strong>Example for adults<br></strong>Fidelity Health Care ETF.

And we’ll take an index of the broad market as a benchmark. This index is called S&amp;P 500 after the agency that created it, Standard &amp; Poor. The index consists of the 500 largest American companies that represent 80% of the US economy. Roughly speaking, they summarize the value of stocks and their change in prices shows general tendency.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Here you can see how the index (and supposedly US economy) have been growing for the past 30 years.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168c1fc4cde46eb34bd9a43_06%20Img%20-%204.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="S&P500 growth in 30 years photo"></div></figure><p>Can you name all the events (1-4) that caused the stock market to fall? <em>(check your answers at the end)</em><br></p><p>Ideally, the prices on the stock market should reflect the fair value of an asset. But in reality expectations towards these assets drive prices far from it, and then we face declines that bring prices back to normal and cool down very optimistic investors (event 1). During the Dotcom bubble (1) many companies were overpriced and their earnings did not match their market value, as a result, the bubble burst and stock prices fell down.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, conflicts or global problems can cause a decline in anticipation of economic slowdown (3 and 4).<br></p><p>On the bright side, you can see that the economy and the stock market recover pretty fast and, as a matter of fact, it’s a big luck to buy stocks at the bottom of such a dip.

Buy S&amp;P 500 index shares and hold them.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Since it would cost a fortune to buy stocks of 500 companies, there are special funds that buy them for you and you just own a share of this fund. In professional language, you buy an S&amp;P 500 ETF.&nbsp;</p><p>S&amp;P 500 ETFs that you can buy:</p><p>- iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV)<br>- Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO)&nbsp;<br>- Fidelity 500 Index Fund (FXAIX)</p><p>It would be very useful if you also read about two other major indexes <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaqcompositeindex.asp">NASDAQ </a>and<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/djia.asp"> DOW JONES.&nbsp;</a>You can buy ETFs for these indexes, too.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Buying index funds is a safe and conservative way to invest.

As part of our trading options 101, we’ll cover some basic options trading strategy for beginners and how to start trading options.<br></p><p>Hopefully by the end we’ll have all the basics of options trading explained.<br></p><h2>Stock Option Contracts</h2><p>A stock option contract is a right to buy or sell a specific amount of a stock at a specific price and for a specific period of time.</p><p>The holder of an options contract can benefit from the price movement of the underlying asset without having to own the asset itself.</p><p>There is a fee for such a contract, called a premium.</p><p>The right to buy or sell at a later date allows an investor to make a profit, as long as the price moves in the direction they want. If it does, they can then exercise the contract, i.e. buy or sell the shares at the agreed price, called the option strike price.</p><p>If the price moves in the opposite direction, they can let the contract expire. In this case all they lose is the premium paid for the option.</p><p>Option contracts are leveraged, meaning an investor is trading with more capital than they are actually using in a transaction. A standard option contract gives an investor the right to buy or sell 100 shares.</p><p>Options themselves can also be traded on the exchange market. That’s because this agreement to buy or sell at a fixed price can generate profit and can be of interest to other traders. So instead of buying or selling the shares, the investor has the option to sell the contract to someone else.</p><p>It’s useful to think of options as bets on whether the price will go up or down.<em>‍</em></p><blockquote><em>A stock option contract is a right to buy or sell a specific amount of a stock at a chosen price before it expires.</em><br></blockquote><p>Here are some characteristics that every option contract has:</p><ul><li><strong>Expiration:</strong> the time at which the contract will expire</li><li><strong>Leverage:</strong> how many shares the investor can buy or sell</li><li><strong>Strike price:</strong> the fixed price for which the investor can buy or sell</li><li><strong>Premium:</strong> the option’s price for the investor<strong><br></strong></li></ul><p>There are two main types of options contracts — “call” and “put.” </p><h3>Call and Put Options</h3><p>A call option is the right to buy an asset at an agreed price, or the strike price. This is used when an investor expects the price of a stock to go up.&nbsp;</p><p>If it goes up, they can buy at the strike price. This is lower than the current market price, so we can buy the shares and make a profit.</p><p>Stonks.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168affcfb6a05d6f9297921_01%20Img%20-%201.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="stonks meme - photo"></div></figure><p>A happy options trader who correctly predicted where a stock would go.</p><p><strong>A put option is the right to sell an asset at an agreed price.</strong> This is useful when an investor expects the price of a stock to fall.<br></p><p>Then, if the price falls, the investor can profit the other way, i.e. sell the stock at a higher price than the new market price.</p><p>Call and put options are similar because selling or buying at prices that are different from the current market prices allows investors to profit, no matter if the market moves up or down.&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s important to make a correct prediction about what is going to happen with the price, otherwise the contract becomes worthless.</p><p>It’s a little like renting an asset. You have a right to use it for a specific period of time and buy it if the price is right.</p><p><strong>If you don’t use it, you lose money.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><h2>What is Options Trading?</h2><p>Options trading refers to buying and selling options on the options market. The answer to “what is options trading?” is slightly more complex than traditional stock trading, but the underlying principle is the same.&nbsp;</p><p>The key thing to remember is that options can be traded just like other financial instruments — stocks, mutual funds and ETFs.<br></p><h2>Stock Market Options Trading Strategies</h2><p>Now let’s discuss some basic options strategies. These are essential to know for understanding options trading for beginners. These include buying calls, buying puts, selling covered calls and buying protective puts.</p><h3>Buying Calls</h3><p>A call option is useful when an investor expects the price of a stock to rise.</p><p>Let’s say a company stock is currently trading at $100 per share. If you’re confident the price will grow, you can get a call option to buy the stock at $100 (the strike price) for a premium of $10 per share and with an expiration time of 6 months.&nbsp;</p><p>A typical options contract is for 100 shares, so you’ll be paying $1000 — that’s $10 premium per share multiplied by 100.</p><p>Let’s say six months later the price goes up to $120. And we have an agreement that lets us buy 100 of these shares at the strike price of $100. Due to leverage, this difference is multiplied by 100.&nbsp;</p><p>Now the option position has value of its own, and the investor has several options.&nbsp;</p><p>They can exercise the contract, buy 100 shares at $100 and sell them at the current price of $120.&nbsp;</p><p>They would be making 20% or $20 per share, which is $2000 in total. But they had to pay the $1000 premium for the contract so they end up with a profit of $1000.</p><p>Not bad for a $20 change.</p><p>The other option would be to sell the contract itself, because it has positive value of its own. In this case, we say that the option is “in the money”.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168b00774f3e5414f6e3cdc_01%20Img%20-%202.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="diagram illustrating call options - photo"></div></figure><p>If the price goes down, the investor wouldn’t be making any money, furthermore, the difference is also multiplied by 100 shares, but our losses are limited to the premium we’ve paid for the contract.</p><p>Any slight change is multiplied by 100. This is why options are similar to bets.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:500px"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168add9c2984061a40f948f_FewWelltodoAsiansmallclawedotter-max-1mb.gif" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="young man saying you''ve got options gif - photo"></div></figure><p><strong>Options give you options. That’s where they get their name.</strong><br></p><h3>Buying Puts</h3><p>When an investor expects the price of a stock to go down, a good strategy can be to buy a put. This is a good way to use leverage to profit from falling prices.&nbsp;</p><p>A put is the opposite of a call option. It gains value as long as the price is falling. If the stock price goes up, the maximum amount we can lose is the premium. If you’re already familiar with short selling, put options work in a similar way. You borrow a stock to sell at a high and buy later at a lower price. The difference between short selling and put options is that with short selling the losses can be unlimited. With put options, your losses are limited to the premium.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/6168b0126d6a1c1d49555cee_01%20Img%20-%204.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="diagram illustrating simple put options - photo"></div></figure><p>Put options can also be used to protect an existing investment, also known as hedging. Say you’ve invested $5000 in a stock but you’re worried it might fall. In this case, you can buy a put option. Then, if the price falls, the put option will work in your favor because you can sell your stocks at $5000 any time before the contract expires. But our put option now has value so you’ll be able to sell the option to other options buyers to make up for the loss.</p><p>When an open option position has its own value, it’s referred to as being in the money.<br></p><h3>Covered Call</h3><p>This strategy is suitable when a trader expects the stock price to stay the same or rise slightly.<br></p><p>It works like this: you buy 100 shares of a stock and sell a call option for these shares. In this case, you’re the one being paid a premium, which provides some protection in case the price falls. You are also agreeing to sell the shares at the strike price.<br></p><p>Let’s say you buy 1,000 Coca-Cola shares (KO) at $50 per share. Then you create 10 call options at $0.50 per share with a strike price of $52 that will expire in one month. Each contract is for 100 shares, so you can charge $50 for each one and $500 for all 10.</p><p>The premium you’ve received reduces the cost basis of the shares, because you got some of the money back through the premium. It’s as if you got the shares for $49.50 each. If the price rises above $52, your counterpart will want to exercise the contract and you’ll have to sell the shares to them at $52.</p><p>Of course, if the price keeps going up, you’d be better off holding the stock rather than selling at a price that’s lower than the market price, so this strategy works best if the price doesn’t change significantly. In this case, you get to keep the premium and the shares.<br></p><h3>Protective Put Strategy</h3><p>This strategy is for investors wishing to protect their existing asset from downside movement. It makes sense when they expect the stock to grow over time but want to protect themselves in the short term.</p><p>This is done by buying a put option against a stock you own. This works like an insurance policy. If the price goes up, your initial investment is growing. If the price falls, you’ll have a put contract that has value, and you can sell it to another trader.</p><p>This type of insurance strategy is also known as hedging an investment.</p><p>It’s also a bit like betting against yourself in sports. If you win, you get the prize money. If you lose, you win the bet.</p><div></div><h2>Other Options Strategies<br></h2><p>The following strategies are more advanced and you need to know what you’re doing to try and implement any of them. But it’s useful to know all the different strategies that option trading offers.<br></p><h3>Married Put Strategy<br></h3><p>This strategy is similar to a protective put, and also works as an insurance for stocks you own. Here the investor buys the equivalent of put options at the same time as buying the shares.</p><p>The difference is that a married put is more like an overall insurance to offset the risk of the whole investment, while the protective put is more likely to be used to insure against a short-term decline.<br></p><h3>Protective Collar Strategy</h3><p>This strategy is a combination of a covered call and a protective put. Here an investor buys an out-of-the-money put option and writes an out-of-the-money call option at the same time for the same stock.</p><p>The protective collar can protect from big losses, but it also limits gains.<br></p><h3>Long Straddle Strategy</h3><p>An investor buys a call option at the same time as a put option for the same stock. This is used when the investor expects the price of a stock to move rapidly in either direction, e.g. in reaction to some news.</p><p>Both options need to have the same strike price and expiration date.</p><p>This way, if the market reacts to the news, they can profit from the price change no matter which way it moves.</p><p>This is another strategy that allows investors to profit from a big price change in any direction. This involves buying a call option that is out of the money (i.e. not in good standing) and a put option simultaneously. They should also have the same expiration date, like in the long straddle strategy, but the strike price for the put should be lower than for the call.<br></p><h2>How to Start Trading Options</h2><p>You’ll need to do a few things before you start trading options. The first is to open an options trading account. Then you’ll need to choose the type of option you’ll be going for and have an idea of what you expect to happen to the price of a stock and decide on your strategy. These are the essential things to do when starting option trading for beginners.<br></p><h3>Open an options trading account</h3><p>The first step to trading options is to choose a broker and open an account with them. You’ll need to verify your identity and go through registration. A good broker will also guide you through the process of trading options.</p><h3>Decide on your options strategy</h3><p>We recommend beginners to stick to the more straightforward strategies: buying calls and puts.</p><p>You have to be confident about your prediction, at least to an extent. If you commit to a call option, you should be prepared to lose your investment if the price falls. Conversely, if you purchase a put option, any slight upward movement will be multiplied by 100 and you won’t be able to profit from it.</p><h3>Determine the expiration date and set up your contract</h3><p>Choosing the right expiration date is key. This is not about long-term growth like in stocks. It''s about the difference between the strike price and the market price when the option is due to expire. So whether it’s 3 months or 6 months, put some thought behind it and try to analyze other factors that may come into play.</p><p>Once you have a hypothesis that makes sense, or you have an automatic personal investment guide (wink-wink), set up your contract.<br></p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Hopefully this article covers all the options trading basics. Here is a recap.</p><p>Options are an affordable instrument that allows an investor to make a big profit, due to leverage. This is possible if the investor can correctly predict if the price of a stock will rise or fall.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a right to buy or sell, not the same as owning shares.</p><p>The key thing is to be able to use an option within the specific timeframe before it expires. If you don’t use it the contract expires worthless.

Marginal revenue is closely linked with another figure, which is the marginal cost (MC). Further production of goods reaches break-even when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. However, this is not the conventional break-even. At the break-even of marginal cost and revenue, it’s time to stop selling. At this point, additional production has no benefits as there is no revenue to be made. Marginal revenue should be more than the marginal cost for the company’s additional production to make sense.</p><p>It is essential to know that the marginal cost can vary from product to product in real life and may even change at different production levels for the same product. The financial ratio calculation will remain the same regardless of the output level.&nbsp;</p><p>However, since the marginal revenue equation is subject to the law of diminishing returns, it will eventually decline with increases in output level. Economic theory states that firms will continue to increase their output in a perfectly competitive economy until marginal revenue equals marginal cost.</p><h2>Marginal Revenue Formula</h2><p>The marginal revenue formula is the sale price of an additional unit produced less than the production costs. It is easy to calculate; to find marginal revenue, a firm can divide the change in total revenue by the change in its total output quantity.</p><p>How to calculate marginal revenue?&nbsp;</p><p>As part of profit economics, to calculate the change in revenue, a company should subtract the revenue figure prior to the sale of the last unit from the total revenue figure after the sale.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61c5dcc1f9884011a34bfd2b_marginal1.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="formula for marginal revenue with illustration - photo"></div></figure><p><em>Figure 1. MR Formula</em></p><p>The marginal revenue calculation serves to quantify production level changes. Businesses usually use it to measure the increase in revenue by producing an additional unit, so usually the denominator is 1.</p><h2>Marginal Revenue Calculation Example</h2><p>Now how to calculate marginal revenue?<br></p><p>For example, a company increases product A production by 150 units and earns $100 in revenue. Marginal revenue will be:</p><p>$100 (change in revenue) / 50 units (change in quantity) = $2 (marginal revenue)</p><p>Another marginal revenue example: </p><p>A company generally sells 20 units for $500 but opts to sell an additional unit for $18. In this case, marginal revenue will be $18. The normal revenue of $25 ($500/20) per unit will not count as the marginal revenue definition MR is only about the additional item sold.<br></p><p>$18 (change in revenue)/ 1(change in quantity) = $18</p><div></div><h2>How to Use Marginal Revenue?</h2><p>From an economic perspective, the definition of marginal revenue means that its application allows companies and their departments to make their arguments for additional production, sales, and promotional activities. The concept of MR in microeconomics provides for using the demand curve and marginal revenue curves to plan out production cycles. This allows companies to apply different economic metrics to finalize markup pricing and other parameters like profit maximization levels and optimum production points.&nbsp;<br></p><h3>Know the impact of each extra unit on revenue<br></h3><p>Selling more product units should lead to better revenues and marginal revenues, profitability, and lower additional costs. It is essential to know what does marginal revenue mean at different production levels. The ratio may measure revenue increment, but this can vary between the number of units produced with time, as other factors like the laws of diminishing returns play their role.</p><p>The law of diminishing returns states that production growth will yield nominal growth in output over time. This means that the company has crossed the point of its optimum production level.<br></p><h3>The relationship between sales and market demand<br></h3><p>Using marginal revenue figures helps companies know the relationship between their sales, market demand for their product, and market competition. Sales match customer needs, which is linked to product branding. Product demand is related to user want.&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose production managers running multiple product lines on their machines must determine which product will earn them more money. Increasing the supply of a product can backfire as the market will see it as low quality or not good enough.&nbsp;</p><p>Market growth and profitability come from knowing the tricky balance between demand, supply, and brand perception, along with the actual impact of marginal revenue on normal production levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61cc6e1a615d2638167c9968_marginal%202.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="marginal revenue and profits graph - photo" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p><em>Figure 2. Marginal Revenue and Profits</em><br></p><h2>Difference Between Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost</h2><p>When marginal revenue equals marginal cost of a product, companies will stop producing additional units of the product or service. As long as the MR is more than the marginal cost (MC), additional production is profitable. The figure below shows that any quantity produced under 75 units (where the marginal cost line crosses the marginal revenue line) will be marginally profitable.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61cc6f47f5803e72d20dbaef_marginal%203.jpg" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" alt="marginal cost marginal revenue graph - photo"></div></figure><p><em>Figure 3. Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost</em><br></p><p>Again, just like marginal revenue is the money made from each additional sale, marginal cost is the cost of producing an additional unit. The figure above shows that further production of units up to the profit maximization point will be profitable as the MC falls below the MR line.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Marginal revenue (MR) is the income from each new unit sold. Marginal revenue is linked with another ratio; the marginal cost (MC). Further production of goods reaches break-even when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. However, this is not the conventional break-even. Here the break-even means that the additional production or sales are not increasing profits.</p><p>It is essential to know that the marginal cost can vary from product to product in real life and may even change at different production levels for the same product. The financial ratio calculation will remain the same regardless of the output level.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what does marginal revenue mean for businesses? The mr equation by definition tells us the additional profit we will make from selling an additional unit of our product. For instance, if you make 12 dozen cupcakes on your own and are considering an order which will require that you bake 15 dozen cupcakes. Baking the additional cupcakes requires hiring someone for 3 hours to help you with the extra work and buying more raw materials than usual, which will mean an additional delivery charge. The total additional cost of the three dozen cupcakes is:<br></p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61eac432318900167fb01a36_37%20Img%20-%204.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="example calculation of marginal cost about cupcakes - photo" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>This means that you shouldn’t take the order without a rate increase, or reducing your delivery charges, or hiring someone cheaper to help you out. Otherwise, you manage your workflow to manage without extra delivery or a helper if you want to make a profit.</p><p>This is the beauty of the marginal revenue formula. It tells you the reality behind additional sales and how profitable they are in economic terms and revenue price. In more advanced cases, knowing how to find mr in economics terms allows companies to make capital expenditure and promotional campaign decisions.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Knowing how to find marginal revenue can help in individual decisions as well. The costs of going for a new job, how much you will earn from it, and how much you will spend to get there (maybe there’s a long commute or an uncompensated residence shift) can help evaluate your decision better.&nbsp;</p><h2>FAQ<br></h2>', 'Marginal Revenue (MR) is the income earned from each new unit sold.

Office Buildings Cap Rates</em></p><p>A capitalization rate can be good or bad, depending on the specific region the property is located in. Property value in New York will be much different from those of the West. For an investor, this means that for $ 1 Mn, there can be different NOIs possible. Similarly, vacancy rates, maintenance charges, and other expenses can vary. In large cities like New York, people always look for cheap rental locations and lower vacancy rates. But maintenance and insurance rates are also higher. This variation from region to region makes the market cap rate a very subjective tool to use.&nbsp;</p><p>Other buildings and localities can impact the gross cap rate for an area. If a new building is available for investment in a place where other buildings are dingy and outdated, the new building NOI could decline.&nbsp;</p><p>A fundamental rule to remember regarding income capitalization rate is that better areas and buildings trade at lower cap rates. At the same time, worse neighborhoods offer higher rates. Experienced traders usually eye high rates with skepticism until they explore the property themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>While market capitalization rates are a valuable metric for comparing and assessing different investment options, it shouldn’t be used on an individual basis to make a buying decision. The decision for investment is very subjective and can vary according to the investor''s risk appetite and earning objectives.&nbsp;</p><p>One drawback with this rate is that the formula doesn’t factor in the cost of financing the property. While it makes the calculation easier, the actual calculation of the transaction does not factor in the mortgage costs, interest rates, and other charges.

Short selling is a sophisticated trading technique that only experienced investors familiar with stock market nuances should try.</p><p>The assumption in short selling stocks is that the stock price will decline, the investor will buy it back at a lower price and sell it to the lender. The difference between the buy and sell price is the trader’s profit.</p><p>Shorting a stock carries a significantly higher risk compared to the risks of passive or active trading. When an investor buys a stock, they risk only the principal stake in the trade. So if they bought a share for $100, they risk just $100.</p><p>However, the investor can lose a lot of money due to short selling risk. For instance, from the $100 share example, if the price doesn’t fall and rises to $250, the investor would lose $150.</p><h2>What is Short Selling Stock?</h2><p>In the short selling process, the short seller trades in borrowed stocks. The trading is done through brokers that offer this service. The broker buys the stock, they lend it to you, and you sell it. Once the stock is sold, your account with the broker is credited with the sale proceeds. You agree to buy the stock sometime in the future to return the loan to your broker. This process is known as covering the short.</p><p>Now let’s talk about why short selling is good. The broker earns a fee from the investors shorting stocks. The broker will also get any dividends issued during this time. As an investor, you buy stocks you forecast as declining in price based on market stability. If the price doesn’t fall, you are out by the transaction charges. If prices rise, you lose the price increase amount and the transaction fees.</p><p>The risks of short selling lie with the investor. The broker’s fee is guaranteed, and the broker can also force to sell the stock, known as <em>covering the short </em>at any time. This means that you buy the stock on the day the broker asks you. If prices on that day are higher than your short rate, you have to bear the difference, which is your trading loss.</p><p>However, most brokers ask for investors to cover the short if other traders want to short sell the stock. It is usual for prices to rise, and you can cut your losses in such a case. This happens because many traders shorting a stock push its price upwards.</p><h2>Pros of Short Selling<br></h2><p>Some of the primary advantages of short selling are as follows:<br></p><h3>Little Capital Injection Needed</h3><p>One of the advantages of short selling is that it allows investors to earn a significant profit without paying out the capital amount needed. Only the fee is required upfront, and the rest will be required by the deal’s close. This means that if the prices fall, you stand to earn a profit on an outlay of the broker’s fee.</p><h3>Earn Money in Falling Markets</h3><p>Shorting the market is the only way that investors and fund managers can make money in falling markets. If the market situation affects the stock price in such a way that stocks are falling, the only way to earn a profit is by utilizing shorts in the market.</p><h3>Hedging a Portfolio</h3><p>Having shorts in your portfolio allows them to hedge your portfolio if you have the stock in your portfolio. If you hedge against the stock falling, you don’t lose if the price drops and your investment is at risk. This can help in managing volatility risk for significant funds.<br></p><h2>Cons of Short Selling</h2><p>Some of the primary disadvantages of short selling are as follows:<br></p><h3>Limited effectiveness</h3><p>As investors investing on the assumption of falling markets is an impractical approach. Markets have both price rises and falls. This means that focusing on just the price falling limits the range of profit potential. The loss potential is also high.<br></p><h3>High Risk</h3><p>Due to the limited range of profits, the risks are very high. If the share price rises, the investor must bear the increased price differential and the broker’s fees. The short sale stock process can push a regular market adjustment and make it into a significant dip. The 2008 crisis provided many examples where using short selling pushed stocks into bankruptcy.<br></p><p>Some short selling stock examples that resulted in crashes are stocks like Bear Stearns in early 2008 and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac in mid-2008. Short positions in Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008 eventually initiated the financial crisis of 2008.</p><div></div><h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Short Selling<br></h2><p>The pros and cons of short selling are summarized below:</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61c367ff76523eeacb66ec65_short%20selling%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="short selling pros and cons table - photo" width="auto" height="auto"></div></figure><p>The risks in short selling seem to outweigh the short selling benefits.

Let’s take a look at the opposite scenario:<br></p><p>Assuming that the shares of AAPL are trading at $100 and you expect them to fall. You borrow 100 shares from your broker and sell them at the same price. You sell them for $100 and earn $10,000.<br></p><p>The shares rise to $110 in the market.<br></p><p>You must now buy 100 shares for $110, which costs you $110 x 100 = $11,000 and settle your debt with your broker.<br></p><p>Your loss will be $10,000 - $11,000 = -$1,000.<br></p><p>Commission fees for the brokers would apply on both stages of the transactions, so many zero commission brokers do not offer short selling transactions.<br></p><h2>Final Thoughts<br></h2><p>Shorting stocks is a standard trading option for investors that have a lot of experience. It is also popular amongst hedge fund managers as it allows them to protect their portfolios from downside risks.<br></p><p>While keeping shares available to short can help create enormous profits, the investor also risks losing a lot of money.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/611f1a475e1dbf534724b41d/61e086730e96798d16fe6fb6_36%20Img%20-%203.jpg" loading="lazy"></div></figure><p>If the market meets expectations, short sellers meaning to secure profits keep the amount leftover from the price they sell and the price they buy at.
